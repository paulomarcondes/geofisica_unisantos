While the near-wellbore effects have been recognized and managed for some time, awareness of the significance of the reservoir scale effects is only now developing, aided by extreme examples such as Ekofisk, {HP/HT} reservoirs and unconsolidated sands. Fractured reservoirs must also be considered to be stresssensitive, with this possibly being masked in the past by high productivities and abundant reserves. It is proposed that the appropriate conceptual model for all reservoirs is that of intact blocks of rocks bounded by discontinuities (fractures and bedding-parallel), loaded by an anisotropic stress state. This model should be used to drive the collection of stress-sensitive reservoir characterization data, knowing that the new generation of coupled simulators can usefully accommodate this data set. The data set listed enables all aspects of reservoir stress-sensitivity to be examined.},

	abstract = {The problem of imaging the intensity distribution of a subsurface acoustic source from passive measurements is considered. The source may be spatially extended, and is assumed to be random and spatially incoherent. Two passive imaging algorithms are examined and shown to be closely related. The first algorithm is based on time-domain migration in which signals recorded by an array of receivers are backpropagated to multiple source locations. The second algorithm is based on backprojecting cross-correlating signals computed between all pairs of receiving elements. When the latter algorithm is applied in two dimensions, the correlation peak can be shown to be the line-integral of the source intensity along a hyperbolic path whose foci are the receiving points. This suggests a filtered-backprojection procedure in which the backprojection is performed along multiple hyperbolic paths. The algorithm is easily generalized to three dimensions, in which the cross-correlated signals are backprojected over hyperboloids. Images using simulated and field data are presented as an illustration.},

These slip areas are, for simplicity, taken to be such that their overall effect is that of a distribution of circular cracks; discontinuities in both normal and tangential components of displacement are allowed, depending on the internal conditions. Dry (gas-filled), partial or saturated liquid fill, or a fill of a weak visco-elastic solid are possible within the theory. the results are given in terms of the mean wave, which, at wavelengths long compared with the scale-lengths of the fault structure, is an accurate approximation to the displacement field. the continuity conditions that arise under this scheme are identical to those for a thin layer of visco-elastic material. However, unlike earlier, more empirical models of an ‘averaged’ fault, the parameters involved are directly related to the fault structure and include crack-crack interactions. It is clear from earlier work that a fault of this type is capable of supporting Stoneley waves.},

Shifts have occurred from diets high in fruits, vegetables, lean meats, and seafood to processed foods high in sodium and hydrogenated fats and low in fiber. These dietary changes have adversely affected dietary parameters known to be related to health, resulting in an increase in obesity and chronic disease, including cardiovascular disease ({CVD)}, diabetes, and cancer. Some intervention trials using Paleolithic dietary patterns have shown promising results with favorable changes in {CVD} and diabetes risk factors. However, such benefits may be offset by disadvantages of the Paleolithic diet, which is low in vitamin D and calcium and high in fish potentially containing environmental toxins. More advantageous would be promotion of foods and food ingredients from our ancestral era that have been shown to possess health benefits in the form of functional foods. Many studies have investigated the health benefits of various functional food ingredients, including omega-3 fatty acids, polyphenols, fiber, and plant sterols. These bioactive compounds may help to prevent and reduce incidence of chronic diseases, which in turn could lead to health cost savings ranging from \$2 to \$3 billion per year as estimated by case studies using omega-3 and plant sterols as examples. Thus, public health benefits should result from promotion of the positive components of Paleolithic diets as functional foods.},

The human genome has hardly changed since the emergence of behaviourally-modern humans in East Africa 100-50 x 10(3) years ago; genetically, man remains adapted for the foods consumed then. The best available estimates suggest that those ancestors obtained about 35\% of their dietary energy from fats, 35\% from carbohydrates and 30\% from protein. Saturated fats contributed approximately 7.5\% total energy and harmful trans-fatty acids contributed negligible amounts. Polyunsaturated fat intake was high, with n-6:n-3 approaching 2:1 (v. 10:1 today). Cholesterol consumption was substantial, perhaps 480 mg/d. Carbohydrate came from uncultivated fruits and vegetables, approximately 50\% energy intake as compared with the present level of 16\% energy intake for Americans. High fruit and vegetable intake and minimal grain and dairy consumption made ancestral diets base-yielding, unlike today's acid-producing pattern. Honey comprised 2-3\% energy intake as compared with the 15\% added sugars contribute currently. Fibre consumption was high, perhaps 100 g/d, but phytate content was minimal. Vitamin, mineral and (probably) phytochemical intake was typically 1.5 to eight times that of today except for that of Na, generally {\textless}1000 mg/d, i.e. much less than that of K. The field of nutrition science suffers from the absence of a unifying hypothesis on which to build a dietary strategy for prevention; there is no Kuhnian paradigm, which some researchers believe to be a prerequisite for progress in any scientific discipline. An understanding of human evolutionary experience and its relevance to contemporary nutritional requirements may address this critical deficiency.},

The decision tree considers geological and geophysical factors affecting stress magnitudes both on the regional and local scale. The {TSI} index is defined by geological and geomechanical parameters.

If the joints are aligned either parallel or perpendicular to the applied loads, the modes of stress distribution are different and the compliances are lower or upper bound values respectively. For a specific model representing either parallel or perpendicular pore alignment, the relation between applied load and induced pore pressure for each model is different. Terzaghi's effective stress law is a compatibility model, while Bishop and Skempton's induced pore pressure relations are equilibrium models. The difference between stress transfer and stress redistribution is examined. The structural compliance of the soil or rock mass frame is found to be more important than that of the intact material when the porosity is greater than 10\%. When porosity is less than 5\%, compliance controls the stress distribution between the fluid and intact rock material.},

	abstract = {Fracture-controlled lineaments, commonly seen where brittle basement is exposed at the earth's surface, are generally restricted to a small number of sets, with angles of 45-90° between sets. The length-frequency distribution of lineaments in each set follows a truncated Poisson function. Such lineaments usually show almost no shearing offset, suggesting a tensile origin. A simple mechanical model of tensile fracturing is used to explain the spacing, directions, and length of lineaments, as well as their depth-frequency distribution. Results suggest that the penetration depth of tensile fractures which produce lineaments at the earth's surface is directly related to their length and that the fracture density is inversely proportional to fracture depth. Finally, the angles between lineament sets may be controlled by the ratio of strength of unfractured rock to that of pre-existing fractures, which might heal with time. The most likely source of tension is tectonic uplift. Fractures due to typical uplifts of 0.5-1 km over distances of 10-100 km may penetrate as brittle fractures to several kilometres into the crust, perhaps to the depth at which seismic activity ceases.},

Femoral artery blood flow increased 270\% above basal in the exercised leg (P {\textless} 0.001) but not in the nonexercised leg, with no differences between the {ARG} and {CON} trials. Mixed and myofibrillar {MPS} were both greater in the exercised leg compared with the nonexercised leg (P {\textless} 0.001), but did not differ between the {ARG} and {CON} treatments.

The purpose is to investigate in three dimensions, the geometries, origins, and sequence of development of structural elements comprising the fault zones.

	abstract = {{AbstactThis} Special Publication is a direct outcome of a small but dedicated group of researchers who met in Pontresina, Switzerland, to review and define the fundamental observations characterizing extensional systems and their application in guiding and constraining modelling efforts and results. The various summaries of the keynote addresses give an objective overview of the state of the art in modelling lithospheric extensional systems, both from the regional scale using dynamic models to individual basins using kinematic models with an emphasis on capturing the extensional history of the Iberia and Newfoundland margins. At the heart of all of these efforts is a simple question: Exactly what mechanisms allow the continental lithosphere to be thinned to the point of rupture? Related questions are: (1) Do crustal and mantle faults play a major role in this thinning process? If so, what is their geometry and does their importance and geometry change with time? (2) Are there other mechanisms of lithospheric and crustal thinning that cannot be imaged on seismic sections? (3) How is deformation accommodated in space and time? (4) What role do inherited mechanical, thermal and/or chemical heterogeneities play in controlling strain distribution and localization? (5) When, how and to what degree does magma production affect the distribution and localization of extension? And (6) what is the stratigraphic record of continental extension and how does it document the extension of the crust and thinning of the lithospheric mantle? The aim of this Special Publication is to address many of these fundamental questions concerning the extreme extension and thinning of continental lithosphere.},

	abstract = {The hydrocarbon industry is moving increasingly towards tight sandstone and shale gas resources – reservoirs that require fractures to be produced economically. Therefore, techniques that can identify sets of aligned fractures are becoming more important. Fracture identification is also important in the areas of coal bed methane production, carbon capture and storage ({CCS)}, geothermal energy, nuclear waste storage and mining. In all these settings, stress and pore pressure changes induced by engineering activity can generate or reactivate faults and fractures. P- and S-waves are emitted by such microseismic events, which can be recorded on downhole geophones. The presence of aligned fracture sets generates seismic anisotropy, which can be identified by measuring the splitting of the S-waves emitted by microseismic events. The raypaths of the S-waves will have an arbitrary orientation, controlled by the event and geophone locations, meaning that the anisotropy system may only be partly illuminated by the available arrivals. Therefore to reliably interpret such splitting measurements it is necessary to construct models that compare splitting observations with modelled values, allowing the best fitting rock physics parameters to be determined. Commonly, splitting measurements are inverted for one fracture set and rock fabrics with a vertical axis of symmetry. In this paper we address the challenge of identifying multiple aligned fracture sets using splitting measured on microseismic events.},

The extension is due in part to lowangle east-dipping normal faults, that are now exhumed in the Tyrrhenian islands and Tuscany, while additional extension is still occurring in the Apennine chain (Umbria region, c. 200 km eastward). This tectonic framework is an example where active extensional processes affecting the Umbria region can be studied in exhumed faults that are no longer active. Here a comparison between the Zuccale Fault ({ZF)}, cropping out in the Isle of Elba, and the Altotiberina Fault ({ATF)}, revealed by geophysical data, seismology and seismic profiles crossing the Umbria region, provide insights into the processes affecting low-angle normal fault development and evolution. Recorded microseismicity suggests that the {ATF} is presently active under a vertical \{sigma\}1. Structural analysis of the {ZF} depict a comparable scenario with fluid involvement during the activity. The comparison of these two structures suggests movements with fluid involvement along gently dipping planes under a vertical \{sigma\}1, implying that these faults are mechanically weak.},

In this paper we present a physical study of the aspect ratio as a function of applied uniaxial stress. We carried out pulse transmission measurements of P- and S-wave velocties in a reference model without inclusions and in a model with penny-shaped neoprene inclusions. The reference model is an anisotropic matrix that consists of stacked plexiglass plates. Rubber discs were used as inclusions in that anisotropic matrix leading to secondary anisotropy. We recorded ultrasonic seismic data using P-wave transducers with central frequency 120 {kHz} and S-wave transducers with 90 {kHz.} We compressed the physical models using pressures ranging from 3 to 15.8 {MPa.} Full crack closure occurs at stress 14.6 {MPa} normal to model faces. Our analysis indicates three different regimens for the behavior of the inclusions. These results suggest a different \%dependence of the crack aspect ratio on uniaxial tress at the low state of stress than usually described in the literature. Though our results are not extensive, they show that simple experimental approaches might provide valuable insight into the behavior of cracked rocks at reservoir stress levels.},

	abstract = {A physical modeling study of the effect of overburden pressure on anisotropic parameters was conducted
using intrinsically orthorhombic phenolic boards as the model. These boards were coupled together with
the help of a pressure device and uniaxial stress was gradually increased while time arrival and velocity
measurements were repeated. Results show maximum increase in compressional and shear wave velocities
ranging from 4\% to 10\% in different directions as a function of increasing uniaxial stress. Anisotropic
parameter gamma generally diminished with increasing pressure and ranged from 0\% to 33\%. We
observed anisotropic behavior attributable to both orthorhombic and {VTI} symmetries. Polar anisotropy
behavior is due primarily to layering or bedding and tends to increase with pressure. Certain anisotropic
parameters however unveil inherent orthotropic symmetry of phenolic.},

The intact rock strength is described by a Hoek and Brown criterion. The joints have no tensile strength and a shear strength described by a Coulomb criterion.

It was thus ideal for evaluating seismic azimuthal imaging versus acquisition geometries for both pressure waves and converted shear waves (Thompson et al, 2002). Through extensive practical experience with the Statfjord survey, Statoil soon verified the benefits and took advantage of the full azimuth acquisition solution offered by {3D} {OBS.} Since 1997, {OBS} surveys have been carried out over a large number of Statoil's geologically complex North Sea oil and gas fields, providing detailed, structural images of the disposition of fault-bounded compartments. Through a discussion of geometric observations and studies from the Norwegian continental shelf, some of the benefit of using ocean bottom seismic for P-wave imaging will be demonstrated.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}The accuracy and limitations of the near-offset P-wave {NMO} velocity estimation in transversely isotropic media have been studied using numerical and physical modelling studies. An expression for the near-offset P-wave {NMO} velocity for a single horizontal reflector in a vertically transversely isotropic layer has been previously obtained: [see full text for equation] where a0 and d respectively represent the vertical P-wave velocity and the P-wave critical anisotropy at oblique angles. The above equation is presented as being valid for any degree of anisotropy. The accuracy of this expression is subject to practical testing in this {paper.\&nbsp;\&nbsp;Single} layered horizontal models were used to carry out the numerical modelling studies. A computer program that calculates P-wave {NMO} velocities in transversely isotropic media was used. This program uses the exact ray and phase velocity equations in generating velocity functions to be used in ray tracing and is known to give accurate results. Using the elastic parameters for measured anisotropy in sedimentary rocks, the near-offset {NMO} velocities are computed using our computer program and the above expression. The results obtained at varying degrees of P- wave anisotropy are compared. The degree of anisotropy varied from very weak to strong and contrasting velocity functions were used in numerical modelling {simulations.\&nbsp;\&nbsp;Phenolite} materials with contrasting velocity functions were used to simulate transversely isotropic media with vertical axes of symmetry in physical modelling tests. Experimental reflection data were collected and velocity analysis was conducted for near-offset traces, and the {NMO} velocity determined by the maximum stack response. The elastic parameters, ao and d, of the Phenolite materials were recovered by an iterative inversion of first arrival travel times. These parameters were used to estimate the near-offset P-wave {NMO} velocity in Phenolite using the {NMO} expression and also with our computer program. The {NMO} velocities obtained from these two methods were compared to that obtained from velocity analysis of the experimental seismic data. These comparisons enabled the validity of the above expression in yielding an accurate P-wave {NMO} velocity to be tested, in the limit of small {offsets.\&nbsp;\&nbsp;Numerical} and physical modelling results obtained from this study indicate that the accuracy of the near-offset P-wave {NMO} equation depends on the nature and degree of anisotropy encountered in a given area, and is not valid for all degrees of P-wave anisotropy. Since this equation is commonly used in estimating the near-offset P-wave {NMO} velocity when processing seismic data acquired over anisotropic sedimentary basins, processing geophysicists should proceed with caution when using this equation.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

While numerical evaluation of the reflection coefficient is straightforward, numerical solutions do not provide analytic insight into the influence of anisotropy on the {AVO} signature. To overcome this difficulty, I present an improved approximation for P-wave reflection coefficients at a horizontal boundary in transversely isotropic media with vertical axis of symmetry ({VTI} media). This solution has the same {AVO-gradient} term describing the low-order angular variation of the reflection coefficient as the equations published previously, but is more accurate for large incidence angles. The refined approximation is then extended to transverse isotropy with a horizontal axis of symmetry ({HTI)}, which is caused typically by a system of vertical cracks. Comparison of the approximate reflection coefficients for P-waves incident in the two vertical symmetry planes of {HTI} media indicates that the azimuthal variation of the {AVO} gradient is a function of the shear-wave splitting parameter , and the anisotropy parameter describing P-wave anisotropy for nearvertical propagation in the vertical plane containing the symmetry axis.},

	abstract = {Studies detailing the neurophysiological effects of spinal manual therapy have fueled a paradigm shift away from a strict biomechanical model. However, a recent systematic review of the temporal nature of a single session of spinal thrust manipulation found that the neurophysiological effects were only temporary. The objective of this review was to examine the temporal nature of neurophysiological effects after one session of spinal mobilization. Studies eligible for this review had to report on the temporal component of the neurophysiological effects of a single session of joint mobilization of the spine in human subjects. In order to be sure that the temporal nature of these effects was captured, the studies had to monitor neurophysiological effects for a time beyond the immediate post-treatment period. This systematic review followed the methodology for preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses. In order to assess the quality, strength, and importance of the included studies, the grading of recommendations assessment, development and evaluation system was used. Results of this review showed that the neurophysiological effects of a single session of spinal mobilization are mostly 5 minutes or less. An exception to these findings is hypoalgesia which may last up to 24 hours, based on one study. Continued research on small samples of healthy subjects with irrelevant immediate outcomes like salivary rate, skin conductance, and skin temperature should give way to randomized controlled trials on subjects with pain and decreased function.},

	abstract = {Differential effective medium theory has been applied to determine the elastic properties of porous media. The ordinary differential equations for bulk and shear moduli are coupled and it is more difficult to obtain accurate analytical formulae about the moduli of dry porous rock. In this paper, in order to decouple these equations we first substitute an analytical approximation for the dry-rock modulus ratio into the differential equation and derive analytical solutions of the bulk and shear moduli for dry rock with three specific pore shapes: spherical pores, needle-shaped pores and penny-shaped cracks. Then, the validity of the analytical approximations is tested by integrating the full differential effective medium equation numerically. The analytical formulae give good estimates of the numerical results over the whole porosity range for the cases of the three given pore shapes. These analytical formulae can be further simplified under the assumption of small porosity. The simplified formulae for spherical pores are the same as Mackenzie's equations. The analytical formulae are relatively easy to analyse the relationship between the elastic moduli and porosity or pore shapes and can be used to invert some rock parameters such as porosity or pore aspect ratio. The predictions of the analytical formulae for experimental data show that the formulae for penny-shaped cracks are suitable to estimate the elastic properties of micro-crack rock such as granite, they can be used to estimate the crack aspect ratio while the crack porosity is known and also to estimate the crack porosity evolution with pressure if the crack aspect ratio is given.},

Except for major extensional features, such as aborted continental rifts, which may act as weak zones, it is usually difficult to find simple geology based models to explain differences in seismic activity in stable continental regions. Seismicity in Brazil is clearly not uniform and a few areas of higher activity have been identified. However, the seismic areas show almost no correlation with the main geological provinces, which is typical of other intraplate settings. A recent upper-mantle tomography study in {SE} and central Brazil, using approximately 8500 P-wave and 2000 {PKP-wave} arrivals recorded in 59 sites since 1992, has mapped P-wave velocity anomalies from lithospheric depths down to 1300 km. In this region, higher seismic activity occurs preferentially in areas with low P-wave velocities at 1502013250 km depth. The low P-wave velocities are interpreted as shallower asthenosphere. In such areas, a hotter geotherm will reduce the strength of the lithospheric upper mantle causing most of the intraplate forces to be concentrated in the brittle upper crust. The low-velocity anomalies coincide with Late Cretaceous provinces of alkaline intrusions. The proposed ponding of the Trindade plume head beneath lithospheric thin spots is consistent with our tomography results, suggesting that plume effects may have helped to preserve lithosphere/asthenosphere topography. Although other factors are also important, the present data show that stress concentrations resulting from lithosphere/asthenosphere topography should play an important role in explaining the intraplate seismicity in the Brazilian platform.},

	abstract = {Variations in vertical stress magnitudes can be attributed to lateral facies variations, diagenesis, localized uplift and disequilibrium compaction overpressure. Vertical stress magnitudes have been calculated using density and checkshot data from 47 wells in the Carnarvon Basin, on the {NW} Shelf of Australia. The vertical stress ranges from 20.2 {MPa} km- 1 to 23.8 {MPa} km- 1 below seabed; demonstrating a significant variation across the basin. The largest vertical stress magnitudes were calculated for the Dampier Sub-Basin, the eastern Barrow Sub-Basin and on the Peedamullah Shelf. The smallest vertical stress magnitudes were calculated in the Kangaroo Syncline, the western Barrow Sub-Basin and offshore across the Exmouth Plateau. High rock densities, thus, high vertical stress magnitudes, can be due to uplifted rock that is over-compacted relative to its current depth. In the Carnarvon Basin, areas of elevated vertical stress magnitudes correspond to areas of identified uplift. Uplift at the Bambra Anticline has previously been estimated to be approximately 900 m. Calculations within the Bambra-4 well demonstrate that a 900 m increase in burial depth of a regionally consistent lithostratigraphic unit (the Muderong Shale) equates to a 0.22 g cm- 3 increase in rock density. Thus, the difference between uplifted, over-compacted rock and normally-compacted rock (no uplift) is equivalent to a difference in the vertical stress magnitude of 2.1 {MPa} km- 1 at the Bambra Anticline. This value, totalling the difference between over-compacted (uplifted) and normally-compacted sedimentary rock (2.1 {MPa} km- 1), accounts for some part of the 3.6 {MPa} km- 1 variation in vertical stress magnitude observed across the Carnarvon Basin. Therefore, recent tectonic uplift has had a significant impact on the present-day magnitude of the vertical stress and is interpreted to be responsible for the majority of observed variation of vertical stress in the Carnarvon Basin.},

All rock types show an anisotropic behaviour which is caused by the orientation of certain minerals. The anisotropy is not dependent on temperature and pressure. Gneiss and peridotite have 520136 per cent anisotropy whereas granite and a metagabbro show values of only 220133 per cent. The smallest velocity is always in the z direction, perpendicular to a schistocity or foliation. It is shown that the data agree with those of field observation. We conclude that anisotropy caused by preferred orientation of minerals must be expected in the whole lithosphere.

	abstract = {Major oil companies cannot continue to tolerate the high cost of exploration failure in a world of low future oil prices. There is a trend in the industry to a rationalization of worldwide exploration and production portfolios. Companies are looking to reduce their cost of finding by lessening the risk of failure at all levels of the exploration process, and stimulating resource replacement and growth through the efficient exploration of basins and plays.
The coastal basins of Brazil offer an opportunity to assess the effectiveness of turbidite exploration along a passive continental margin, where non-marine, shelf, and deepwater exploration and production have taken place. The predominant role and strategy of Petrobras, the Brazilian national oil company, in the development of exploration offshore Brazil is worth looking at closely. When oil companies are planning new country-new basin ventures in passive margin deeper water environments worldwide, a lot can be learned from comparisons with similar but mature exploration environments with successful proven petroleum systems.
Petrobras are showing the way forward in efficient, lower-risk, passive margin exploration and exploitation at more acceptable costs of {E\&P.} An exploration strategy based on play focus, play environment, and deepwater technology development seems to be working in the Campos Basin, offshore Brazil. Driven by a desire for Brazilian energy self-sufficiency before the year 2000, Petrobras' mission is to achieve significant reserve and production growth through an exploration focus on the deep water Campos Basin.
Exploration and production success in the Campos Basin is enabling Petrobras to manage their exploration portfolio better, and to minimise the cost of failure in other passive margin basins. A thematic statistical approach to the analysis of future play potential has given rise to a clearer assessment of offshore exploration risk, particularly exploration on the shelf versus in deeper water. This has helped Petrobras to develop a more focused exploration strategy, and has enabled them to allocate their {E\&P} annual budgets more cost efficiently in their drive for oil self-sufficiency.
New windows of opportunity are now opening for exploration success in Brazilian passive margin coastal basins hitherto considered past their best. The recent ability of Petrobras to explore outside the Campos Basin in new deeper water frontier passive margin basins, and achieve early discovery success, shows the value of experience and strategic focus.
Worldwide, the exploration for new, often subtle, clastic turbidite plays is a potentially high cost enterprise. Passive margin exploration is moving swiftly into deeper waters of the South Atlantic off West Africa, as well as the North Atlantic West of the Shetlands. These areas offer a high-risk, high-reward challenge, and drilling environments in need of innovative new {E\&P} technology and creative initial exploration strategies. Brazil, through its national oil company Petrobras, leads the way in this effort.},

The first technique appeals to any kind of attributes and is based on learning and recognition process. The second technique, the {AVO-AVAZ} analysis (Amplitude Versus Offset and Amplitude Versus {AZimuth)}, uses simultaneously the amplitude, the offset and the azimuth. They are used with neither learning nor recognition process, only with interpretation. The P waves need to be calibrated with the S waves to really go to the fracture level and we show their potential to extant locally known information from the S waves to large areas (especially {3D} data). This should have a tremendous impact on the design of future seismic acquisition but we suggest that most of the already recorded {3D} P wave data should be analyzed and interpreted again if anisotropy analysis is important.},

denial to universal acceptance, so that many international geophysical meetings now have sessions on seismic anisotropy. Over
this period, the proceedings of the biennial series of International Workshops in Seismic Anisotropy ({IWSAs)} have captured
many of the notable advances in the theory, calculation, observation and interpretation of particularly shear-wave splitting
(seismic birefringence) in the Earth’s crust. Shear-wave splitting is the almost-infallible indicator of seismic anisotropy
along the ray path. This paper reviews 13 {IWSA} meetings ({0IWSA–12IWSA)} as a catalogue of 25 years of progress in seismic anisotropy.
The evidence now suggests that shear-wave splitting monitors the low-level pre-fracturing deformation of the stress-aligned
fluid-saturated microcracks pervading almost all in situ rocks in the crust. Shear-wave splitting indicates that microcracks
are so closely spaced they are critical systems with all the universality, calculability, predictability, “butterfly wing’s”
sensitivity, and deterministic chaos that that implies. This leads to a New Geophysics, where low-level deformation can be
monitored with shear-wave splitting, future behaviour calculated–predicted with the anisotropic poro-elastic model of rock
evolution, and in some circumstances even potentially controlled by feedback. We anticipate the New Geophysics will greatly
invigorate {IWSA.}},

	abstract = {T the mechanism of quasi-static plane strain fracture in poro- and thermoelastic materials for arbitrary stress fields, it is necessary to consider not only tensile fracture but also shear fracture. An impulsively sheared semi-infinite crack is considered for the mathematically analogous cases of coupled quasi-static thermo- and poroelastic materials. The exact solution is obtained in Laplace and Fourier transform domains using the Wiener--Hopf technique. The crack tip behaviour is then analysed. The stress intensity factors as a function of the Laplace transform variable are identified for cracks with either permeable (conducting) or impermeable (insulating) crack faces, and are inverted numerically for all times and asymptotically for small times. The case of a steadily propagating shear crack with either permeable or impermeable crack faces is also examined; the crack tip behaviour is examined in detail and compared with the result for a permeable fault. Analytical results are found in the neighbourhood of the crack tip. The pore pressure fields are found explicitly for all x {andy.The} case where the entire fault is assumed impermeable is reworked and an analytical solution is given for the pore pressure. The relevance of the results for stabilising shear faults and earthquake mechanics is briefly discussed. For the most part, the solutions in this paper and an earlier one refer to situations involving a complete coupling of the poroelastic equations and boundary conditions. This occurs when the material ahead of the crack is continuous and is relevant to the fracture of "virgin" rock. In the other papers cited in this article and elsewhere this has not usually been the case; the interface along which the crack propagates has usually been assumed to have a particular property as far as the pore pressure is concerned. It is worth stressing that the most complete situation is considered here; the pore pressure condition ahead of the crack is set only by the anti-symmetry (or symmetry) of the problem and the condition on the crack faces is set by the physical situation.},

	abstract = {Curvature attribute applications on {3D} seismic horizon surfaces have recently been demonstrated for the prediction of fractures. Different curvature attributes have been shown to be correlated with open fractures measured on outcrops. These applications are limited by the interpreter's ability to pick horizons of interest on {3D} seismic data volumes. This could be a challenging task in datasets contaminated with noise and also in zones where the rock interfaces do not exhibit significant impedance contrast to warrant a pickable horizon. Very recently, volumetric computation of curvature has been introduced, which dispels the need for horizons and provides valuable information on fractures orientation and density in zones where horizons are not trackable. Several applications of volume curvature have been completed in different geological settings, that define small scale faults, isolate highly fractured zones and also relate such fractures to spatial variation of strain. While a direct prediction of open fractures using curvature attributes requires a significant amount of calibration through the use of production, tracer, image logs or microseismic measurements, volumetric curvature attribute analysis serves as a powerful aid to stratigraphic interpretation. Such fault/fracture interpretation has been ably supplemented with a calibration procedure with well log data, in that the orientations of the fault/fracture lineaments interpreted on curvature displays can be combined in the form of rose diagrams, which in turn can be compared with similar diagrams obtained from {FMI} (Formation Micro-Imager) well logs to gain confidence in calibration. Interpretation and calibration of stratigraphic features on volume curvature displays will be demonstrated.},

	abstract = {Sixty patients with foot or ankle trauma were randomized and treated in three groups. In intermittent impulse compression, an air pad under the foot was inflated every 20 seconds, thus activating the venous foot pump. In continuous cryotherapy, ice water circulates between the ice box and the cold pad. The ice water was changed once per day. In standard therapy, the injured extremity was treated with cool packs, which were changed 4 times per day. Beginning at admission, every 24 hours the circumference was measured around the ankle, midfoot, and forefoot. After 24 hours of treatment, there was a 47\% reduction in swelling with the A-V impulse System, 33\% with continuous cryotherapy, and 17\% with cool packs. After 4 days of postoperative treatment, the A-V impulse System reduced the swelling by 74\% versus 70\% with continuous cryotherapy and 45\% with cool packs. Both new methods are preferable to cool packs. Because of the better preoperative results, the A-V impulse System proved to be the most effective device.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a model to predict time-dependent instability of arbitrarily oriented wellbores. The underlying factor to make the borehole collapse time-dependent is the increase of pore pressure around the wellbore due to mud penetration over time. The time-dependent pore pressure around the wellbore is estimated by analyzing two-phase fluid flow in porous media. The petrophysical parameters required for two-phase flow analysis, such as capillary pressure and absolute and relative permeabilities are characterized from experimental data. The model for time-dependent borehole collapse analysis is then developed by incorporating the transient pore pressure in the widely used wellbore failure analysis model. Potential wellbore failure modes are mathematically defined and guidance is incorporated to identify the upper and the lower bounds of the safe mud window at a particular time. The developed model is applied to wells in shale under different stress regimes. Results demonstrate that an initial safe mud window becomes narrower as the time progresses. Consequently, a mud weight, which was initially safe, may become unsafe and results in borehole collapse after a certain period of time. Such a failure is further influenced by the orientation of the wellbore and different stress regimes.},

In contrast, European countries, Asian countries, and Canada do not have an upper limit for {DC.} Further, current epidemiologic data have clearly demonstrated that increasing concentrations of {DC} are not correlated with increased risk for {CHD.} Clinical studies have shown that even if {DC} may increase plasma low-density lipoprotein ({LDL)} cholesterol in certain individuals (hyper-responders), this is always accompanied by increases in high-density lipoprotein ({HDL)} cholesterol, so the {LDL/HDL} cholesterol ratio is maintained. More importantly, {DC} reduces circulating levels of small, dense {LDL} particles, a well-defined risk factor for {CHD.} This article presents recent evidence from human studies documenting the lack of effect of {DC} on {CHD} risk, suggesting that guidelines for {DC} should be revisited.},

In this case it is shown that failure may take place, according to circumstances, either in the plane of weakness or in planes cutting across it. The second criterion refers to a layered material whose shear strength varies continuously from a maximum in one direction to a minimum in the perpendicular direction. In this case it appears that, instead of the two directions of failure possible for an isotropic material, there is only one possible plane of failure which lies between the plane of minimum shear strength and the nearest to it of the two Coulomb-Navier planes. Numerical results are given for the case of uniaxial compression and experimental results are shown to be in reasonable agreement with them.},

Rock masses are usually fractured, as a result of various geological processes over time. The effect of joints on the strength of a rock has been studied mainly using analytical or experimental methods, whereas the strength of fractured rock is usually expressed in terms of empirical failure criteria. In this study, the original plane of weakness theory is presented and applied to rock models with various numbers of joint sets persistent or not. Biaxial compressive tests are then performed on the same specimens using a discrete element code. To account for the roughness of the discontinuities, the original theory is extended, by imposing the non linear Barton-Bandis shear strength criterion for the discontinuities. This extended theory of one plane of weakness is validated against the responses of discrete numerical rock models with various combinations of fracturing. Both, the original and extended theories, are then applied to simulate the response of physical experiments undertaken by several researchers, in order to investigate their validity and the bounds of their usage. The numerical results are in accordance with the theoretical ones, while the theoretical results have an either quantitative or qualitative similarity with the experimental ones. Quantitative differences appear especially when the specimens fail in different modes than assumed by the models.},

{STUDY} {DESIGN:} Systematic review assessing the evidence base for cryotherapy in the treatment of acute soft-tissue injuries.
{METHODS:} A computerized literature search, citation tracking, and hand searching were carried out up to April 2002. Eligible studies were randomized-controlled trials describing human subjects recovering from acute soft-tissue injuries and employing a cryotherapy treatment in isolation or in combination with other therapies. Two reviewers independently assessed the validity of included trials using the Physiotherapy Evidence Database ({PEDro)} scale.
{RESULTS:} Twenty-two trials met the inclusion criteria. There was a mean {PEDro} score of 3.4 out of of 10. There was marginal evidence that ice plus exercise is most effective, after ankle sprain and postsurgery. There was little evidence to suggest that the addition of ice to compression had any significant effect, but this was restricted to treatment of hospital inpatients. Few studies assessed the effectiveness of ice on closed soft-tissue injury, and there was no evidence of an optimal mode or duration of treatment.
{CONCLUSION:} Many more high-quality trials are needed to provide evidence-based guidelines in the treatment of acute soft-tissue injuries.},

Assuming that the pore pressure induced on the crack plane reduces the effective compressive stress (total stress minus pore fluid pressure) and as a result, the frictional resistance, we find that the energy required to drive the crack is decreased by up to about 60\% of the value required in a purely elastic solid. The required energy decreases with velocity at low and high velocities, but increases with velocity for Vl/c in the range of 100.5-102, where V is th speed of propagation. l is the loaded length of the semi-infinite crack and c is the diffusivity. When the effect of the pore pressure induced on the crack plane is neglected, the results are qualitatively similar to those of Rice and Simons (1976. J. Geophys. Res. 81, 5322-5344) for the permeable crack: coupling between deformation and diffusion stabilizes propagation in the sense that the energy that must be supplied to drive the crack increases with velocity within a finite range of the ratio Vl/c is about an order of magnitude lower than that for the permeable crack, but includes the range cited above and is within the range of observed creep events on the San Andreas fault.},

Main Lower Cretaceous rift structures controlled themselves by strike-slip deformation belts related to Proterozoic orogenic events, have been episodically reactivated during the divergent margin phase of Campos Basin, from the Albian to the Miocene. Balanced cross-sections of major salt structures indicate that such tectonic reactivations have been controlling thin-skinned salt tectonics, triggering pulses of gravitational gliding above the Aptian salt detachment. Additionally, major basin features like the Neogene progradation front and the salt tectonic domains are constrained by the main Proterozoic orogenic trends of the Ribeira Belt ({NE-SW)} and the Vitória-Colatina Belt ({NNW-SSE).} As the basement involved structures observed in Campos Basin can be attributed to general geodynamic processes, it is suggested that basement tectonic reactivation can be as relevant as isostatic adjustment and detached thin-skinned tectonics on the structural evolution of divergent margin settings.},

	abstract = {Soft-tissue knee surgery is performed for a multitude of conditions and encompasses a large number of procedures. The post-operative management of these conditions is constantly evolving as a result of advances in technology and a better understanding of human physiology, however, there remains no consensus on the ideal timeframe over which loading can be progressed. Rehabilitation protocols provide basic guidelines through which effective outcomes can be achieved. However, the rate and extent of recovery will depend on many patient and external factors, and it is questionable whether full recovery or a return to normality is ever complete.

The complex neuromuscular motor patterning, strength and control which are affected by injury and surgery are very difficult to gauge, and difficult to recreate. Isokinetic testing affords a validated, reliable and reproducible method of evaluating muscle strength, endurance and antagonist/agonist balance. It may be utilized at the earliest safe opportunity to establish the efficacy of any functional rehabilitation programme and can allow adjustments to be made to optimize outcomes. Future studies into the use of Pilates programmes and their effects on earlier muscle pattern retraining may also allow for safer and earlier returns to sporting activity.

This review establishes an evidence-based approach to the post-operative rehabilitation of the knee following anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, arthroscopic meniscectomy, and meniscal repair surgery.},

Earthquake data indicate that normal faults exist in the upper crust with dip angles commonly as shallow as 30°. Some structural evidence suggests brittle-normal faulting with dip angles as shallow as 10°. One explanation of the apparent conflict between theory and structural/seismic observations is that intrinsically weak, shallow-dipping pre-existing faults are preferentially reactivated. Any reduction in frictional strength of the pre-existing structure below that of surrounding rock increases the likelihood that such structures will be first breaking when extension is initiated. Enhanced fluid pore pressure on the pre-existing fault reduces the effective strength and can further enhance shallow fault reactivation. An analytical treatment clarifies the roles of geometry, intact/pre-existing fault strengths and fluid pore pressures. Frictional strength ratios of 3 or greater could account for extremely shallow normal faults (dips 10-20°) without consideration of pore pressures in excess of the least principal stress or of principal stress systems rotated away from the gravity vector. Moderate reduction in friction () with respect to wall rock can reduce the dip to 30° and can account for shallow normal-slip earthquakes.},

	abstract = {Anisotropic cracked media have been widely investigated in many theoretical and experimental studies. In this work, we perform ultrasonic surveys to investigate the influence of source frequency on elastic parameters (the Thomsen parameter  and shear-wave attenuation) of fractured anisotropic media. Under controlled conditions, we prepared anisotropic models containing penny-shaped rubber inclusions in a solid epoxy resin matrix with crack density that ranges from 0 to 6.2 \%. Two of the three models have 10 layers and the last has 17 layers, the number of uniform rubber inclusions per layer was from 0 up to 100. S-wave splitting measurements have shown that scattering effects are more prominent in models where the crack aperture to seismic wavelength ratio ranges from 1.3 to 13.3 than other models where the ratio was varied from 2.3 to 23. The model with large cracks gave a magnitude of attenuation 3 times higher compared with another model that had small inclusions. These results indicate acoustic scattering, attenuation (intrinsic and apparent), and velocity dispersion directly interfere in shear wave splitting, which in turn is a function of crack aperture and source frequency.},

The anisotropy is the result of stress-aligned fluid-saturated grain-boundary cracks and pore throats in almost all crustal rocks, and we suggest by stress-aligned grain-boundary films of liquid melt in the uppermost 400 km of the mantle. The evolution of such fluid-saturated microcracks under changing conditions can be modelled by anisotropic poro-elasticity ({APE).} Numerical modelling with {APE} approximately matches a huge range of phenomena, including the evolution of shear-wave splitting during earthquake preparation, and enhanced oil recovery operations. {APE} assumes, and recent observations of shear-wave splitting confirm, that the fluid-saturated cracks in the crust and (probably) upper mantle are so closely spaced that the cracked rocks are highly compliant critical systems with self-organised criticality. Several observations of shear-wave splitting show temporal variation displaying extreme sensitivity to small stress changes, confirming the crack-critical system. Criticality has severe implications for many Solid Earth applications, including the repeatability of seismic determinations of fluid flow regimes in time-lapse monitoring of hydrocarbon production. Analysis of anisotropy-induced shear-wave splitting is thus providing otherwise unobtainable information about deformation of the inaccessible deep interior of the Earth. © 2004 Elsevier {B.V.} All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The ability to delineate and accurately predict fractured reservoir conditions provides critical information for field development strategies, and development of play concepts in less-developed areas. To demonstrate relationships and differences between fracture-controlled production, stratigraphy, and structural geology, the Piceance and Michigan basins were used as sites for integrated fracture detection programs utilizing potential field, imagery, seismic, and conventional subsurface structural and stratigraphic mapping. All of the tools that have been used in this analysis are readily applicable to other basins. In the contraction-dominated Piceance Basin, the Parachute, Rulison, Divide Creek and Wolf Creek fields produce gas from fractured tight gas sand and coal reservoirs within the Mesaverde Group. Tectonic fracturing involving basement structures is responsible for significant permeability within the reservoirs and provides pathways for gas migration into reservoir sands. The importance of detecting natural fractures using the integrated fracture detection technique is critical to developing tight gas resources. Imagery and potential field geophysical analysis of the Michigan Basin reveal that extension-dominated basement trends, in addition to glacial features, are interpretable through surficial methods. Oil production from Paleozoic horizons, excluding reef trends, are aligned with basement fracture trends. Shallower, naturally fractured Devonian-age Antrim Shale gas production is apparently controlled and localized by basement structure. Analysis of radiometric data confirm the orientations and locations of basement structural trends. Integration of data from widely available, relatively inexpensive sources provide excellent data sets to incorporate into an overall methodology for targeting fractured reservoirs. As demonstrated through comparison of these two basins, a key to successful exploration efforts is the integration of independent data sets because no individual tool will necessarily prove diagnostic in every situation.},

	abstract = {An amazing congruence of seemingly unrelated, diverse global events began in the Middle and Upper Miocene and established our modern world. Two global orogenic belts were active, mostly in the Middle and Upper Miocene, while backarc basins formed along the eastern margin of Asia. Coincident with these events global temperatures cooled in both the ocean and atmosphere, desertification occurred from Central Asia into and across most of northern Africa and also in Australia, and in southern South America. Coincident with the expansion of the Antarctic ice cap at 14 Ma, there was initial widespread deep sea erosion and changes in patterns of deep sea sedimentation. Muddy pelagic sedimentation increased six-fold in the North and Central Atlantic and Pacific Oceans and global changes in circulation lead to more diatomites in the Pacific and fewer in the Atlantic. By the end of the Miocene most of the Mediterranean Sea had evaporated. Broadly coincident with these events, many old, large river systems were destroyed and new ones formed as much of the world's landscape changed. Collectively, these global on-shore tectonic and ocean-atmospheric events provide the foundation for our modern world--a mixture of new and rejuvenated orogenic belts and their far-field effects (distant epiorogenic uplift, rain-shadow deserts, large alluvial aprons, and distant deltas) as inherited Gondwanan landscapes persisted remote from plate boundaries. Thus at the end of the Miocene much of the world's landscape, except for that changed by Pleistocene continental glaciation, would be recognizable to us today.
We argue that all of these events had the same ultimate common cause-an internal Earth engine-that drove plate motions in two broad ways: first, the opening and closing of seven key gateways to deep-water oceanic currents radically altered global heat transfer and changed a lingering Greenhouse to an Icehouse world; secondly, these events were in part coincident with renewed heat flow in the African and Pacific Superplumes that energized global plate motions in the Middle and Upper Miocene. We hope this global synthesis will stimulate more research on the many global events of the Miocene--to understand better both our modern world and earlier global orogenies.},

Measured quantities such as porosity, permeability, resistivity and P- and S-wave velocities were cross plotted, and possible correlations were investigated. Identified experimental trends were then tested against a variety of rock physics models. A good correlation was obtained in most cases. Such results together with petrophysical logging data can be used to constrain possible joint inversion of controlled source electromagnetic data and seismic data. The simultaneous use of resistivity and acoustic measurements to monitor a water-substituting-oil process at reservoir conditions was also investigated. This study indicated that the electrical properties are much more sensitive to changes in saturation in the case of water flooding for enhanced oil recovery than the elastic properties.},

For waves longer than l′ the medium is shown to behave like a homogeneous, or nearly homogeneous, transversely isotropic medium whose density is the average density and whose elastic coefficients are algebraic combinations of averages of algebraic combinations of the elastic coefficients of the original medium. The nearly homogeneous medium is said to be ‘long-wave equivalent’ to the original medium. Conditions on the five elastic coefficients of a homogeneous transversely isotropic medium are derived which are necessary and sufficient for the medium to be ‘long-wave equivalent’ to a horizontally layered isotropic medium. Further conditions are also derived which are necessary and sufficient for the homogeneous medium to be ‘long-wave equivalent’ to a horizontally layered isotropic medium consisting of only two different homogeneous isotropic materials. Except in singular cases, if the latter two-layered medium exists at all, its proportions and elastic coefficients are uniquely determined by the elastic coefficients of the homogeneous transversely isotropic medium. The observed variations in crustal P-wave velocity with depth, obtained from well logs, are shown to be large enough to explain some of the observed crustal anisotropies as due to layering of isotropic material.},

	abstract = {Ice, compression and elevation are the basic principles of acute soft tissue injury. Few clinicians, however, can give specific evidence based guidance on the appropriate duration of each individual treatment session, the frequency of application, or the length of the treatment program. The purpose of this systematic review is to identify the original literature on cryotherapy in acute soft tissue injury and produce evidence based guidance on treatment. A systematic literature search was performed using Medline, Embase, {SportDiscus} and the database of the National Sports Medicine Institute ({UK)} using the key words ice, injury, sport, exercise. Temperature change within the muscle depends on the method of application, duration of application, initial temperature, and depth of subcutaneous fat. The evidence from this systematic review suggests that melting iced water applied through a wet towel for repeated periods of 10 minutes is most effective. The target temperature is reduction of 10-15 degrees C. Using repeated, rather than continuous, ice applications helps sustain reduced muscle temperature without compromising the skin and allows the superficial skin temperature to return to normal while deeper muscle temperature remains low. Reflex activity and motor function are impaired following ice treatment so patients may be more susceptible to injury for up to 30 minutes following treatment. It is concluded that ice is effective, but should be applied in repeated application of 10 minutes to be most effective, avoid side effects, and prevent possible further injury.},

Break-up in the South Atlantic realm developed diachronously: rifting started in the south (Argentina) during the Jurassic and progressed towards the equatorial segment. The central portion was controlled by a rift-resistant cratonic nucleus (the Sao Francisco-Congo craton) and as a result underwent development of narrow basins; parts controlled by Neoproterozoic fold belts developed wide basins. The final break-up of western Gondwana and the onset of plate divergence were marked by thick wedges of seaward-dipping reflectors, located near the incipient ocean-ridge spreading centre that had already been formed by the time Aptian evaporites were deposited. Subsequently, a few episodes of intraplate tectonic and magmatic activity affected the Santos, Campos and Espirito Santo basins. Post-break up development of the offshore basins was affected by gravity gliding over the Aptian evaporites. Continental uplift may be invoked as the main cause of salt mobilization, generating prograding clastic wedges that thickened basin-wards and produced a loading effect on the salt basin. Coupled with onshore erosional unloading and the effects of the gravity gliding, this probably resulted in further flexural uplift of the continental margin.},

	abstract = {It is now well established that protein supplementation after resistance exercise promotes increased muscle protein synthesis, which ultimately results in greater net muscle accretion, relative to exercise alone or exercise with supplementary carbohydrate ingestion. However, it is not known whether combining carbohydrate with protein produces a greater anabolic response than protein alone. Recent recommendations have been made that the composition of the ideal supplement post-exercise would be a combination of a protein source with a high glycemic index carbohydrate. This is based on the hypothesis that insulin promotes protein synthesis, thus maximising insulin secretion will maximally potentiate this action. However, it is still controversial as to whether raising insulin level, within the physiological range, has any effect to further stimulate muscle protein synthesis. The present commentary will review the evidence underpinning the recommendation to consume carbohydrates in addition to a protein supplementation after resistance exercise for the specific purpose of increasing muscle mass. The paucity of data will be discussed, thus our conclusions are that further studies are necessary prior to any conclusions that enable evidence-based recommendations to be made.

	abstract = {The ever growing use of elastomers and polymers in structures leads to the need of pertinent multiaxial fatigue life criteria for such materials. Thus, the understanding of the fatigue crack initiation micro-mechanisms and their link to the local stress and/or strain history is essential. Scanning electron microscopy and Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy ({EDS)} have been used to investigate those micromechanisms on a natural rubber.
Rigid inclusions were systematically found at the crack initiation. Depending on the type of inclusion (identified by {EDS)}, cavitation at the poles or decohesion are the very first damage processes observed. Cracks orientations are compared to local principal stress orientation history, the later being obtained from finite element calculations ({FE).} It is shown that if large strain conditions are correctly taken into account, cracks are found to propagate systematically in the direction given by the maximal first principal stress reached during a cycle, even under non-proportional loading. A fatigue life criterion is proposed.},

The transient, three-dimensional, two-phase numerical model is presented for simulating the simultaneous flow of gas and water through porous and fractured media. The specific problem to which the numerical simulation is applied assumes a single horizontal fracture perpendicular to the flow direction in a quite small geometry. The equations solved treat both fluids as incompressible and immiscible. Accounted for are the effect of capillary pressure and relative permeability. Technically, the finite volume approach is used to discretize the equations. The set of discretized and linearized equations is solved using the {IPSA} (inter-phase slip algorithm) method. The results of this study indicate that the multi-layer reservoir provides better estimates of post-fracture performance compared to a more conventional, single-layer reservoir description.},

	abstract = {A fundamental problem with the characterization of fractured reservoirs is that there is a scale of structure that is difficult to identify - that between well bore and seismic. A new workflow for structural characterization is presented here based on the application of Shell's software for the highlighting of structural discontinuities from seismic, using the patent pending {"Van} Gogh" technology: the Stopper-Voxels, in conjunction with {SVS:} Shell's software for fractured reservoirs. Stopper-Voxels were generated over the Malampaya field in the Philippines, a Miocene age carbonate build-up. The larger bodies typically represent faults, which can be validated interactively against the seismic, however the smaller bodies may represent fractures, with no easily discernible offset. {SVS} was used for correlation of Stopper-Voxels with other data to discern their properties and dissociate true structural discontinuities from artificial discontinuities. Stopper-Voxel bodies have a variety of orientations across the field, whereas conductive fractures from borehole images have a consistent {WNW-ESE} orientation, sub-parallel to the in-situ stress. Therefore not all of the Stopper-Voxels are likely to be conductive to flow, despite a good correlation with mud-losses in some wells. Stopper-Voxels have been used to assess the connectivity of the water and gas legs via the oil rim, which would have implications for future gas development. Stopper-Voxel technology has been applied on a number of large fields in the Middle East for fracture detection. Accurate and reliable fracture detection has obvious benefits for waterflood and {EOR} projects, which are becoming increasingly relevant for many Middle Eastern countries.},

These tools include gravity, magnetic, seismic, electrical, electromagnetic, and radioactivity studies. All aspects of these methods are described, including theoretical considerations, data acquisition, and data processing and interpretation, with the objective of locating concentrations of natural resources and defining their extent. In the past fourteen years or so since the writing of Applied Geophysics, there have been many changes in the field of exploration geophysics. The authors give full treatment to changes in this field, which include improved techniques for calculating gravity fields, the use of proton-precession and optically-pumped magnetometers, improved quality of seismic data, magnetotelluric as a practical exploration method, new electromagnetic exploration methods, the use of gamma-ray spectrometers in radioactive exploration, and improved well-logging techniques. The intent is to be practical, and thus many actual examples and problems are given. Moreover, wherever possible in this edition the authors adopt the use of Système Internationale ({SI)} units, which were not in standared use at the time of the first edition. The reader needs only a general background knowledge of geology, physics, and mathematics. Most of the math can be skipped by those interested only in the results. Advanced mathematical concepts are explained in the appendix.},

	abstract = {The behaviour of rays at interfaces in anisotropic viscoelastic media is studied using three different approaches: the real elastic ray theory, the real viscoelastic ray theory and the complex ray theory. In solving the complex eikonal equation, the highest accuracy is achieved by the complex ray theory. The real elastic and viscoelastic ray theories are less accurate but computationally more effective. In all three approaches, the rays obey Snell's law at the interface, but its form is different for each approach. The complex Snell's law constrains the complex tangential components of the slowness vector. The real viscoelastic and elastic Snell's laws constrain the real tangential components of the slowness vector. In the viscoelastic ray theory, the Snell's law is supplemented by the condition of the stationary slowness vector of scattered waves. The accuracy of all three ray theoretical approaches is numerically tested by solving the complex eikonal equation and by calculating the {R/T} coefficients. The models of the medium consist of attenuating isotropic and anisotropic homogeneous half-spaces with attenuation ranging from extremely strong (Q= 2.520133) to moderate (Q= 25201330). Numerical modelling shows that solving the complex eikonal equation by the real viscoelastic ray approach is at least 20 times more accurate than solving it by the real elastic ray approach. Also the {R/T} coefficients are reproduced with a higher accuracy by the real viscoelastic ray approach than by the elastic ray approach.},

	abstract = {In a recent rock physics study, anomalously high {Vp/Vs} ratios were observed relative to expectations in unconsolidated reservoir sands at shallow burial depths. For the wet sands, the {Vp/Vs} ratios were high relative to the surrounding shales. The wet sands also had high {Vp/Vs} ratios relative to laboratory measurements. For gas sands, the {Vp/Vs} ratios observed in logs were high relative to laboratory measurements of dry samples. For oil sands, the observed {Vp/Vs} ratios were high relative to predictions using existing rock physics models. The observed behavior cannot be explained using factors such as porosity, lithology, clay content, pressure, temperature, compaction or cementation. However, the observed behavior can be explained as a result of stress-induced anisotropy. Since the vertical stress is normally much higher than the horizontal stresses in a relaxed sedimentary basin, the compressional wave is fast in the vertical direction, but the shear wave is slow. This consequently gives high {Vp/Vs} ratios in the vertical direction. A rock physics model that includes the effect of differential stress was applied to compute anisotropic elastic parameters. Preliminary results show that its effect on {Vp/Vs} can be bigger than the fluid effect (oil versus gas). The model has also been applied to two deepwater wells. We observed significant improvement in S-wave log prediction and in the predicted {AVO} behavior compared to the observed seismic response.},

	abstract = {Microearthquakes (microseismic events) are induced during hydrocarbon and geothermal fluid production operations in naturally fractured reservoirs. They typically result from shear-stress release on pre-existing faults and fractures due to production/injection induced perturbations to the effective stress conditions. These stress changes may be due to reservoir depletion, flooding or stimulation operations. Over a number of years it has been shown that microseismic monitoring has the potential to provide valuable time-lapse {3D} information on the geomechanical processes taking place within a reservoir. These processes include the distribution of fluid flow and pressure fronts within naturally fractured systems, production-related compaction and the reactivation of faults. With the advent of permanent reservoir monitoring systems (e.g. intelligent wells) microseismic monitoring has the potential to become a practicable means of time-lapse imaging of hydrocarbon reservoir processes remote from production/injection boreholes. This paper illustrates some of the ways in which microseismic monitoring can contribute to the development and management of hydrocarbon reservoirs through the presentation of examples from both hydrocarbon and geothermal reservoirs.},

	abstract = {A distinct class of structures can form as a result of extension along a plane of anisotropy (foliation). The effect of the foliation is to decrease the ductility of the material in this orientation so that brittle fractures or shear-bands develop. Foliation boudinage is caused by brittle failure; extensional fractures cause symmetric boudinage, and shear fractures cause asymmetric boudinage.
Extensional crenulation cleavage is defined by sets of small-scale ductile shear-bands along the limbs of very open microfolds in the foliation. The sense of movement on the shear-bands is such as to cause a component of extension along the older foliation. Conjugate cleavage sets indicate coaxial shortening normal to the foliation; the shortening axis bisects the obtuse angle between the sets. A single set indicates oblique or non-coaxial deformation.
Extensional crenulation cleavage is microstructurally and genetically distinct from other types of cleavage. It does not occur as an axial plane structure in folds, and has no fixed relationship to the finite strain axes. It is common in mylonite zones, and may be favoured by crystal-plastic and cataclastic deformational mechanisms. These cause grain-size reduction, and hence softening, which favour the development of shear-bands.},

As these techniques can be utilized in both vertical and highly deviated wells, they have had extensive application in the petroleum industry where knowledge of stress orientation and magnitude at depth is important for addressing a wide range of problems. The techniques we have developed for estimation of the maximum horizontal principal stress, {SHmax}, make extensive use of observations of non-catastrophic failures of the wellbore wall--both compressive failures (breakouts) and tensile failures (drilling-induced tensile fractures) as well as the stress perturbations associated with slip on faults cutting through the wellbore. The widespread use of wellbore imaging in the petroleum industry has been a critical development that makes utilization of these techniques possible. In addition to reviewing the theoretical basis for these techniques, we present case studies derived from oil and gas fields in different parts of the world. These case studies document the facts that the techniques described here yield (i) consistent stress orientations and magnitudes over appreciable depth ranges within and between wells in a given field (thus indicating that the techniques are independent of formation properties), (ii) stress magnitudes that are consistent with absolute and relative stress magnitudes predicted by Anderson and Coulomb faulting theories, (iii) stress orientations and relative magnitudes that are consistent with regional stress indicators and tectonics observed with other techniques at much larger scales and (iv) sufficiently well-constrained estimates of the full stress tensor that are useful in application to engineering problems such as wellbore stability.},

The data invariably showed non-linear behaviour, irrespective of the rock and joint type. A hyperbolic function is suggested to describe the stress-closure/opening curves of joints. Quantitative relations between normal deformability and relevant joint parameters (aperture, wall strength and roughness) are developed. Tentative conclusions on the changes in normal stiffness during shearing are also presented. The behaviour of dislocated (mismatching) joints is studied qualitatively and analytically. Shear deformability was studied by performing direct shear tests under normal stresses in the range of engineering interest. It is shown that behaviout in the pre-peak range is invariably non-linear depending on the joint type, and can be adequately described by easily measured parameters and hyperbolic functions.},

Curved slip lineations suggest a progressive change in the stress field during a single displacement event, whereas non-coaxial slip lineations suggest periodic reactivation of a fault under different stress conditions. If the direction of slip is assumed to reflect the direction of maximum shear stress acting on a pre-existing fault, changes in only the relative magnitudes of principal stresses acting on the thrust sheet are sufficient to cause changes in slip-lineation orientation. Consequently, curved and/or non-coaxial slip lineations simply may record temporal changes in principal-stress magnitudes resulting from syntectonic erosion, changes in tectonic-stress magnitude, and ramping of thrusts to shallower depths. We illustrate that a decrease in overburden or an increase in the magnitude of tectonic stress results in a progressive up-dip rotation of slip lineations on a fault surface, a rotation which could be misinterpreted as indicating polyphase deformation caused by changes in regional displacement directions. Changes in pore pressure do not influence the trajectory of slip on a fault surface, but rather affect the conditions governing the likelihood for slip to occur.},

	abstract = {This paper discusses the evolution and the Late Proterozoic assembly of the South American continent (i.e. the West Gondwana) under the light of global tectonics. The northern portion of the continent--the Amazonian craton--is a {"Pre-Brasiliano"} domain; it may be a fragment derived from Laurentia. This domain behaved as a large continental plate which was accreted to the central and southeastern portions of the continent ({"Brasiliano} domain"). The Brasiliano domain had a more complex history and composition during the Brasiliano cycle (Middle Proterozoic to Early Paleozoic).
In the Brasiliano domain, several Late Proterozoic continental plates have been identified (São Luiz-West Africa, Congo-{Kasai/São} Francisco, Rio de La Plata, Arequipa-Antofalla) which acted as forelands to the Brasiliano orogenic belts that surround and amalgamate these plates. Smaller fragments of Pre-Brasiliano continental lithosphere are common in the interior of the Brasiliano orogenic belts and played diversified roles (microplates, microcontinents, "structural highs"). Some of them have acted as true backlands (hinterlands) flanked by arc magmatism.
Two principal types of Brasiliano orogenic belts are recognized between the continental plates: (a) marginal orogenies to the Late Proterozoic plates, with pelitic-carbonatic rocks and discrete volcanism, which were thrust by collision onto the margin of the plates, and which seem to represent final products of previous passive margin sequences; (b) distal orogenics (internal belts within the continental masses, sometimes a branching system of orogenics), that contain varied clastic and minor carbonate sedimentary rocks, accompanied by important bimodal volcanism and calc-alkaline plutonism. For these orogenies a greater variety of basinal scenarios and tectonic settings may be visualized.
The amalgamation of the continent during the Late Proterozoic, i.e. the formation of the Brasiliano structures, indicates the existence of practically synchronous multilateral stresses within lithospheric plates. This can be produced by complementary adjustment of the continental plates as a response to major global events elsewhere (analogous to modern continental collisions).
Two large and important tectonic zones may be candidates to such a scenario: the Hijaz-Mozambique zone (site of connection of East and West Gondwana) and the Transbrasiliano lineament, which cuts across South America and extends to North Africa following the zone of connection between Pre-Brasiliano and Brasiliano domains.
Other small ocean-openings and -closings inside the various Brasiliano areas (Dom Feliciano-Gariep, for instance) were minor events and complementary to the other two major tectonic zones mentioned above.},

However, a recent systematic review of the temporal nature of a single session of spinal thrust manipulation found that the neurophysiological effects were only temporary. The objective of this review was to examine the temporal nature of neurophysiological effects after one session of spinal mobilization. Studies eligible for this review had to report on the temporal component of the neurophysiological effects of a single session of joint mobilization of the spine in human subjects. In order to be sure that the temporal nature of these effects was captured, the studies had to monitor neurophysiological effects for a time beyond the immediate post-treatment period. This systematic review followed the methodology for preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses. In order to assess the quality, strength, and importance of the included studies, the grading of recommendations assessment, development and evaluation system was used. Results of this review showed that the neurophysiological effects of a single session of spinal mobilization are mostly 5 minutes or less. An exception to these findings is hypoalgesia which may last up to 24 hours, based on one study. Continued research on small samples of healthy subjects with irrelevant immediate outcomes like salivary rate, skin conductance, and skin temperature should give way to randomized controlled trials on subjects with pain and decreased function.},

	abstract = {The cross-spread formed by intersecting source and receiver lines, or “hybrid gather” consisting of all common mid-points ({CMPs)} in a reflection patch defined by the acquisition geometry, has been revived in recent years as a possible solution to the increasing need for ever-improving imaging of 3-D seismic reflection data. These hybrid gathers, however, are currently not widely used in processing. Development of processing procedures for hybrid gathers is needed to further the efficiency of their application. The use of hybrid gathers in processing is justified by their performance as an areal array in attenuating both random and coherent noise from all azimuthal directions. Hybrid gathers also allow for azimuthal filtering to correct for wave propagation effects. Through an azimuthal analysis in an azimuthally anisotropic medium, the effects of structural dip on reflection time can be isolated and separated from pre-stack propagation effects of the media, particularly distortions due to azimuthal anisotropy. A binning strategy is determined for hybrid gathers which best allows for azimuthal anisotropy to be observed and distinguished from structural dip. This allows for improved velocity estimation for imaging and separate analysis of azimuthal variations in propagation properties of subsurface media at an early stage in the processing sequence. The degree and orientation of the anisotropy can then be estimated using a semblance method.},

	abstract = {The South American plate is now in horizontal compression and shortening. This is shown by stress data compilations, intraplate stress field numerical models and space-based geodetic results. Consistent with the compressive scenario, analyses of leak-off and hydraulic fracturing data indicate that the maximum principal stress is horizontal for most Brazilian basins. The observed compression/shortening is probably mostly due to the convergence of the South American and the Nazca plates and the divergence of the South American and the African plates. Plate-wide deformation related to the Andean tectonics has been evidenced by analyses of integrated visualizations of available plate-scale information on tectonics, continental geology, topography/bathymetry, seismicity, stresses, active deformation, residual isostatic anomalies, fission track analyses, and seismically derived Moho depths and P and S wave velocity anomalies. Here, some results of these analyses are presented and some implications of the ongoing compression for petroleum exploitation and exploration are discussed. A conceptual model for the plate-wide deformation is presented and numerically tested using elasto-plastic rheologies. The model states that in response to the compression, the lithosphere as a whole (or only the crust if thermal gradients are high enough) tends to fold and fracture. This tendency is stronger during peaks of the Andean orogeneses. The forming antiforms are responsible for uplift along the erosional basin borders, whereas the forming synforms are sites of continental sedimentation, at basin centres. The denudation of sedimentary covers promotes the exhumation of deeper and deeper rocks, cropping out at the foot of retreating scarps. Consequently, the erosional borders of the basins form local topography highs with respect to the adjacent basement. In exploration, neotectonics is usually simply disregarded, at least with regard to the exploratory activities developed in passive' margin basins. Nevertheless, we infer that neotectonics has an important role in the distribution and preservation of petroleum accumulations, since: (i) accumulations are ephemeral in a geological time scale, being strongly dependent on the seals's fine geometry and biodegredation; (ii) a strong positive correlation exists between permeability anisotropy and maximum horizontal stress; (iii) the source rocks of the most important Subandean and intraplate petroleum systems are still in the oil generation window; and (iv) the disruption of kitchens' of generation is a positive factor to primary migration. This inference seems to be confirmed, since the most important South American petroleum accumulations are found along the actively deforming border between the South American and Caribbean plates. Indeed, the most important accumulations in marginal basins are found in the southeastern Brazilian margin (the Campos basin), which has been deformed the most with respect to other margins during the Cenozoic, and continues to be the most seismically active.},

	abstract = {A quarter century has passed since the first publication of the evolutionary discordance hypothesis, according to which departures from the nutrition and activity patterns of our hunter-gatherer ancestors have contributed greatly and in specifically definable ways to the endemic chronic diseases of modern civilization. Refinements of the model have changed it in some respects, but anthropological evidence continues to indicate that ancestral human diets prevalent during our evolution were characterized by much lower levels of refined carbohydrates and sodium, much higher levels of fiber and protein, and comparable levels of fat (primarily unsaturated fat) and cholesterol. Physical activity levels were also much higher than current levels, resulting in higher energy throughput. We said at the outset that such evidence could only suggest testable hypotheses and that recommendations must ultimately rest on more conventional epidemiological, clinical, and laboratory studies. Such studies have multiplied and have supported many aspects of our model, to the extent that in some respects, official recommendations today have targets closer to those prevalent among hunter-gatherers than did comparable recommendations 25 years ago. Furthermore, doubts have been raised about the necessity for very low levels of protein, fat, and cholesterol intake common in official recommendations. Most impressively, randomized controlled trials have begun to confirm the value of hunter-gatherer diets in some high-risk groups, even as compared with routinely recommended diets. Much more research needs to be done, but the past quarter century has proven the interest and heuristic value, if not yet the ultimate validity, of the model.},

	abstract = {Integration of fracture information derived from diverse sources including well log, outcrop and seismic reflection data is important for improving petroleum production from fractured reservoirs. Seismic methods provide constraints on the extent and connectivity of fractures which geologic methods alone cannot provide. In this study we will demonstrate several seismic techniques that are useful for fracture and fault characterization, including seismic continuity, advanced spectral decomposition, curvature analysis and seismic azimuthal p-wave amplitude analysis. Each method is sensitive to different physical characteristics of fractured rock. We will show by example that the application of multiple seismic methods integrated with geology and well information produces an optimum analysis of a fractured reservoir. Our examples are from the Barnett Shale, Fort Worth Basin, Texas and Teapot Dome in Wyoming. The Barnett Shale is an unconventional tight gas reservoir whose wells must be hydraulically fractured during completion in order to stimulate production. Mapping of fractured areas using curvature analysis and azimuthal amplitude variation aids in avoiding areas of existing fractures and karsting which can interfere with successful well completions. Teapot Dome is a tight oil reservoir with several stacked pays situated on a thrust-related anticline. Fault and fracture areas are mapped using a combination of seismic continuity, advanced spectral decomposition and curvature analysis integrated with geologic information. Results from these two areas will be compared to applications of similar methods to other reservoirs.},

	abstract = {Background: After anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction ({ACLR)}, motivation to return to previous levels of activity is high. Very few studies have used return-to-activity criteria to determine when to permit athletic play. Return-to-activity measures objectively evaluate functional limb symmetry; however, previous biomechanical studies have found gait deviations in these individuals that persist up to 2 years after surgery.
Purpose: To evaluate gait biomechanics in a specific cohort of {ACL} patients 1 year after surgery and retrospectively compare individuals who pass return-to-activity criteria 6 months after surgery with those who fail.
Study Design: Prospective analysis.
Methods: A total of 40 athletes who participated regularly ({\textgreater}50 h/y) in cutting, jumping, and pivoting activities and who sustained an isolated, unilateral {ACL} rupture were included in this study. All participants underwent reconstruction by the same surgeon and received individualized postoperative rehabilitation. Performance-based and self-report data were measured 6 months after surgery to assess readiness to return to activity (90\% outcome required to pass); 20 subjects passed return-to-activity criteria and 20 subjects did not. Motion analysis was performed 1 year after surgery, and knee flexion angles, moments, and excursions were measured during gait and evaluated for all subjects.
Results: There was no limb × group interaction or effect of group for all measures. Decreased knee measures were seen on the involved limb compared with the uninvolved limb for all subjects, and failed subjects demonstrated larger differences between limbs.
Conclusion: Patients continued to demonstrate biomechanical limb asymmetries 1 year after {ACLR}, regardless of performance-based measures at 6 months. Early return to activity did not ensure limb symmetry at 1 year.
Clinical Relevance: Gait asymmetries were seen in all subjects 1 year after surgery regardless of status at 6 months. Potentially prolonging athlete’s timelines for returning to activity may prove beneficial for a successful return to activity as well as for long-term knee function.},

These models imply hypothetical extensional structures and large horizontal movements between the two conjugate margins (more than 250 km for the Brazilian and Angolan Margins). Refraction/reflection data together with the most recent and tightest pre-opening fit using continental and oceanic, geological and geophysical constraints show that the substratum of the sag basin is divided into an autochthonous part (upper continental crust) and an allochthonous part (exhumed material). The thinning process, which evolves in an elevated position of the system until at least the break-up, seems to be depth dependent and to mainly concern the lower/middle crust, which we postulate is exhumed. This exhumation does not explain the entire thinning of the system: horizontal motions cannot alone explain the formation of the huge Angolan-Brazilian Basin. Similar observations are made on the whole Central Segment of the South Atlantic Ocean. Part of the lower continental crust is still missing and it seems most improbable that the continental crust maintains its integrity throughout the thinning process.},

	abstract = {Debate continues as to whether normal faults may be seismically active at very low dips (\{delta\} {\textless} 30\{degrees\}) in the upper continental crust. An updated compilation of dip estimates (n = 25) has been prepared from focal mechanisms of shallow, intracontinental, normal-slip earthquakes (M {\textgreater} 5.5; slip vector raking 90\{degrees\} \{+/-\} 30\{degrees\} in the fault plane) where the rupture plane is unambiguously discriminated. The dip distribution for these moderate-to-large normal fault ruptures extends from 65\{degrees\} {\textgreater} \{delta\} {\textgreater} 30\{degrees\}, corresponding to a range, 25\{degrees\} {\textless} \{theta\}r {\textless} 60\{degrees\}, for the reactivation angle between the fault and inferred vertical \{sigma\}1. In a comparable data set previously obtained for reverse fault ruptures (n = 33), the active dip distribution is 10\{degrees\} {\textless} \{delta\} = \{theta\}r {\textless} 60\{degrees\}. For vertical and horizontal \{sigma\}1 trajectories within extensional and compressional tectonic regimes, respectively, dip-slip reactivation is thus restricted to faults oriented at \{theta\}r [≤] 60\{degrees\} to inferred \{sigma\}1. Apparent lockup at \{theta\}r \{approx\} 60\{degrees\} in each dip distribution and a dominant 30\{degrees\} \{+/-\} 5\{degrees\} peak in the reverse fault dip distribution, are both consistent with a friction coefficient \{micro\}s \{approx\} 0.6, toward the bottom of Byerlee's experimental range, though localized fluid overpressuring may be needed for reactivation of less favorably oriented faults.},

	abstract = {Because compressional-waves are relatively insensitive to fractures, conventional P-wave seismic surveys are generally not well suited to detecting the presence of fractures in the subsurface. However, recent theoretical and experimental work has shown that shear waves are sensitive to the presence and orientation of fractures. Subsurface fracture systems normally consist of nearly vertical, aligned fractures, creating a zone of effective anisotropy with an axis of symmetry in a near horizontal plane. Shear waves entering such a zone necessarily split into two or more phases with different velocities and polarization. A number of investigators have suggested that this shear-wave splitting and polarization could be recorded and interpreted by recording all three components of wave motion. To test this hypothesis, the Dept. of Geophysics at Colorado School of Mines acquired 5 miles of 3-component P and {SH-wave} surface seismic Vibroseis data over a known fractured reservoir. In addition, 3-component P and {SH-wave} {VSPs} were recorded in a nearby well. Funding for this research was provided by a consortium of 13 industrial sponsors and data acquisition was completed in November 1985.},

Similarly, geological field studies of the low permeability siliceous shales in the Monterey Formation, California, clearly indicate that faults influence hydrocarbon transport. We report here a study of the Antelope Shale, a low permeability siliceous shale hydrocarbon reservoir in the Buena Vista Hills field in the southern San Joaquin Valley to determine the influence of the stress state on the relative hydraulic conductivity of the fractures and faults present in the subsurface. Because production has both lowered reservoir pressure and the horizontal stresses, it was necessary to "restore" the reservoir stress state to initial conditions in order to identify correctly the most highly productive intervals. This analysis demonstrates that prior to production, faults in the reservoir were active in a transitional reverse/strike-slip faulting stress state, consistent with regional tectonics. Initial production rates in the field were 2000 barrels of oil per day, principally from intervals where critically stressed faults were encountered.},

	abstract = {Background: We examined the associations between muscular strength, markers of overall and central adiposity, and cancer mortality in men.
Methods: A prospective cohort study including 8,677 men ages 20 to 82 years followed from 1980 to 2003. Participants were enrolled in The Aerobics Centre Longitudinal Study, the Cooper Institute in Dallas, Texas. Muscular strength was quantified by combining 1-repetition maximal measures for leg and bench presses. Adiposity was assessed by body mass index ({BMI)}, percent body fat, and waist circumference.
Results: Cancer death rates per 10,000 person-years adjusted for age and examination year were 17.5, 11.0, and 10.3 across incremental thirds of muscular strength (P = 0.001); 10.9, 13.4, and 20.1 across {BMI} groups of 18.5-24.9, 25.0-29.9, and ≥30 kg/m2, respectively (P = 0.008); 11.6 and 17.5 for normal ({\textless}25\%) and high percent body fat (≥25\%), respectively (P = 0.006); and 12.2 and 16.7 for normal (≤102 cm) and high waist circumference ({\textgreater}102 cm), respectively (P = 0.06). After adjusting for additional potential confounders, hazard ratios (95\% confidence intervals) were 1.00 (reference), 0.65 (0.47-0.90), and 0.61 (0.44-0.85) across incremental thirds of muscular strength, respectively (P = 0.003 for linear trend). Further adjustment for {BMI}, percent body fat, waist circumference, or cardiorespiratory fitness had little effect on the association. The associations of {BMI}, percent body fat, or waist circumference with cancer mortality did not persist after further adjusting for muscular strength (all P ≥ 0.1).
Conclusions: Higher levels of muscular strength are associated with lower cancer mortality risk in men, independent of clinically established measures of overall and central adiposity, and other potential confounders. (Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev 2009;18(5):1468–76)},

However, few studies evaluate the diet effects in rats behavior or cicatrization. The objective of this work was to analyze the influence of the ketogenic diet on the weight gain, emotional behavior of the rats submitted to experimental models such as elevated plus maze ({EPM)} and open field ({OF).} The cicatrization time and leukocyte differentiations were also observed. Twenty male Wistar rats of two months age were divided into two groups. One was submitted to ketogenic diet ({KD)}, and the control group (Co) was fed on commercial rations. After 7 days, the animals were weighed and submitted to {EPM} and {OF.} A small surgical incision was made and their blood was collected to a leukocyte count. It was verified that the rats from the {KD} presented less weight gain as compared with the rats from the Co (p {\textless} 0.05). The {KD} did not reveal differences on the behavior measures in the {EPM} model, but in the {OF} presented an ambulatory activity significantly bigger. The animals from the {KD} presented a cicatrization significantly better than Co after 72 h (p = 0.0035) and 96 h (p {\textless} 0.1). There was no difference between the groups for leukocyte count. Our results suggest that the {KD} can interfere on rats deambulation in animal models and improve the cicatrization response.},

The purpose of this paper is to show how rock mechanics interprets geologic information and helps to adapt engineering design to rock conditions. The paper analyses eight case histories of large engineering projects. In five cases the designers took careful account of the conditions prevailing in the rock masses, the rock characteristics, the strength of the rock and the modified stress--strain pattern created by the new structure. The intrinsic curve of the rock mass, the Coulomb condition, the residual stresses and {theE-modulus} in the families of joints are among the more important characteristics of the rock mass. In two case histories, it is shown how an erroneous estimate of the cleft-water pressures caused disaster.
Rock mechanics is a necessary link between engineering and geology.},

	abstract = {This paper reviews some strength criteria which include the role of the intermediate principal stress, and proposes a new criterion. Strength criteria of the form [{sigma]oct=fN([sigma]oct)}, such as Drucker-Prager, represent a rotation surface in the principal stress space, symmetric to the line [sigma]1=[sigma]2=[sigma]3 in the meridian plane. Because [{sigma]oct=fN([sigma]oct)} must fit the pseudo-triaxial compressive strength, it will have a non-physical outcome for triaxial extension. Mogi's criteria, [sigma]oct=g1([sigma]m,2) and [sigma]max=g2([sigma][beta]) are able to fit experimental data reasonably well, but the prediction of strength is not good and sometimes problematic. Strength criterion with the form [lambda]([sigma]1, [sigma]2, [{sigma]3)=F[[eta]([sigma]1}, [sigma]2, [sigma]3)], or a curve of two variables which can be decided by fitting pseudo-triaxial experimental data, is not expected to describe the strength under various stress states, no matter how high the correlation coefficient of [lambda] and [eta] is, or how low the misfit of the equation [{lambda]=F([eta])} is, as these seemingly good correlations usually result from the dominant influence of the maximum principal stress in the metrics of [lambda] and [eta]. The intermediate principal stress may improve the strength of rock specimen, but its influence will be restricted by [sigma]3. Also when [sigma]2 is high enough to cause failure in the [sigma]2-[sigma]3 direction, the strength will decrease with the increasing [sigma]2. The new strength criterion with exponent form has just such a character, and gives much lower misfits than do all seven criteria discussed by Colmenares and Zoback [Colmenares {LB}, Zoback {MD.} A statistical evaluation of intact rock failure criteria constrained by polyaxial test data for five different rocks.

	abstract = {We investigate the stress-dependent permeability issue in fractured rock masses considering the effects of nonlinear normal deformation and shear dilation of fractures using a two-dimensional distinct element method program, {UDEC}, based on a realistic discrete fracture network realization. A series of "numerical" experiments were conducted to calculate changes in the permeability of simulated fractured rock masses under various loading conditions. Numerical experiments were conducted in two ways: (1) increasing the overall stresses with a fixed ratio of horizontal to vertical stresses components; and (2) increasing the differential stresses (i.e., the difference between the horizontal and vertical stresses) while keeping the magnitude of vertical stress constant.
These numerical experiments show that the permeability of fractured rocks decreases with increased stress magnitudes when the stress ratio is not large enough to cause shear dilation of fractures, whereas permeability increases with increased stress when the stress ratio is large enough. Permeability changes at low stress levels are more sensitive than at high stress levels due to the nonlinear fracture normal stress-displacement relation. Significant stress-induced channeling is observed as the shear dilation causes the concentration of fluid flow along connected shear fractures. Anisotropy of permeability emerges with the increase of differential stresses, and this anisotropy can become more prominent with the influence of shear dilation and localized flow paths. A set of empirical equations in closed-form, accounting for both normal closure and shear dilation of the fractures, is proposed to model the stress-dependent permeability. These equations prove to be in good agreement with the results obtained from our numerical experiments.},

This paper describes a set of shear box tests on intact sandstone specimens which concentrated on the sequential development of elementary fractures during loading and the surface morphology. The role of stress concentration in initiation and propagation is emphasized. Although both parts of the specimen tended to rotate relatively during shearing, inducing an inhomogenous stress/strain distribution, it is shown that an increasing normal stress led to an increasing striated/non-striated surface ratio, while isolated shear surfaces (facing the movement of the missing block) tended to be replaced by numerous tight (Riedel-type) shears dipping in the sense of movement of the missing block; rupture was also less brutal with increasing normal stress. The resulting features seem homologous with already described fault plane structures corresponding to small displacements; the formation conditions of these structures are also discussed.},

Existing models can either handle the pre- or post-peak deformation of intact rock or joints alone; however, a model which can determine the failure mode and simulate the complete pre- and post-deformation of rock mass with multi-sets of joints is not yet available. This study focusses on rock mass with multi-sets of ubiquitous joints and establishes a mathematic model and an associated numerical implementation accounting for the anisotropy in strength and deformation induced by the existence of joints. Accordingly, an approach incorporating the existing models or methods to enable simulation of the complete deformation of rock mass is proposed. In addition to the pre- and post-peak deformation characteristics for intact rock, the pre-peak deformation of joint, such as the closure, shear and dilatancy effect as well as its post-peak deformation, such as the reduction on roughness, have also been taken into account. A series of comparisons validates that the proposed model is capable of presenting the joint-induced anisotropy in strength and deformation of rock mass, determining the possible failure modes and reasonably simulating the complete stress-strain relationship as well.},

Transfer faults form where cross faults connect distinct normal faults and horizontal displacements predominate over vertical ones. In contrast, release faults form where cross faults associated with individual normal faults die out within the hangingwall before connecting to other normal faults, and have predominantly vertical displacements. Release faults are geometrically required to accommodate variable displacements along the strike of a normal fault. Thus, they form to release the bending stresses in the hangingwall, and do not cut normal fault planes nor detachment surfaces at depth. Release faults have maximum throws adjacent to normal faults, and may be nearly perpendicular or obliquely oriented to the strike of the latter. Such geometry appears not to depend upon pre-existing weaknesses, but such variable orientation to normal faults is an inherent property of release faults. Release faults commonly appear as simple normal faults in seismic sections, without implying extension along the strike of rift and basins. Three-dimensional strain deformation occurs in the hangingwall only between the terminations of an individual normal fault, but regionally, release faulting is associated with plane strain deformation in linked extensional fault systems.},

This issue is essential as the use of seismic noise is more and more popular for seismic hazard purposes with a growing number of processing techniques based on the assumption that the noise wavefield is predominantly consisting of fundamental mode Rayleigh waves. This survey reveals an overall agreement about the origin of seismic noise and its frequency dependence. At frequencies higher than {1�Hz}, seismic noise systematically exhibits daily and weekly variations linked to human activities, whereas at lower frequencies (between 0.005 and {0.3�Hz)} the variation of seismic noise is correlated to natural activities (oceanic, meteorological...). Such a surface origin clearly supports the interpretation of seismic noise wavefield consisting primarily of surface waves. However, the further, very common (though hidden) assumption according which almost all the noise energy would be carried by fundamental mode Rayleigh waves is not supported by the few available data: no \#average\# number can though be given concerning the actual proportion between surface and body waves, Love and Rayleigh waves (horizontal components), fundamental and higher modes (vertical components), since the few available investigations report a significant variability, which might be related with site conditions and noise source properties.},

The theory allows seismic P and S-wave velocities for shales to be inverted for the orientation distribution of clay particle contacts and allows the normal and shear stiffness of the contact regions between clay platelets to be obtained as a function of stress. The ratio B $_{\textrm{N}}$ {/B} $_{\textrm{T}}$ of normal to shear compliance of the contact regions between clay particles is found to be sensitive to the saturation state of the shale. Inversion of velocity measurements for fully-saturated shales show a low value of B $_{\textrm{N}}$ {/B} $_{\textrm{T}}$ when compared with measurements on air-dry shales, consistent with the expected reduction in normal compliance in a fluid-saturated low permeability rock. For all shales considered, B $_{\textrm{N}}$ {/B} $_{\textrm{T}}$ is found to be less than unity. The contacts between clay particles are therefore more compliant in shear than in compression.},

	abstract = {This paper discusses a worldwide dataset of deep seismic reflection profiles that help the understanding of crustal behaviour and the genetic processes that are involved in the formation of sedimentary basins. The events observed in seismic reflection data at lower crustal depths correspond to impedance contrasts associated with one or a combination of the following factors: shear zones, thin layers of intrusive rocks, underplated material, gneissic banding, fluids and heterogeneities in the crust and mantle. Several types of sedimentary basins have been recognized with the aid of deep seismic reflection data: basins formed along active master faults; basins formed along inactive faults; basins with no fault control; basins formed by low angle detachment faults; and basins formed by pervasive pure shear, or an approximately pure shear, where the lower crust has been locally extended by a different amount than the upper crust. The mechanisms of basin forming processes recognized in deep seismic profiles are: (a) simple shear along low angle detachment faults extending to the lower crust and maybe the upper mantle; (b) thinning of the lower crust and mantle by ductile processes, convective mechanisms or flow in the mantle and the upper crust by faulting, resulting in an overall pure shear; and (c) thinning of the lower crust associated with phase changes in the mantle or non-conservation of mass. Two end-member models of basin formation involving lithospheric stretching may be recognized in the South Atlantic: simple shear stretching, where only the upper crust is involved in the process and mantle uplift is offset relative to the basin; and pure shear stretching, where uplift of the mantle vertically balances the basin fill. The first mechanism has been suggested for the onshore Tucano Basin. The data obtained for the offshore Campos Basin suggests regional lithospheric stretching and crustal thinning with Moho uplift compensating for sediment accumulation in the basin depocentre. Complex relationships between sediment accumulation and crustal thinning are obtained in the western limit of the Campos basin.},

	abstract = {The East Brazilian Rift system (Ebris) constitutes the northern segment of the South Atlantic rift system which developed during the Mesozoic breakup of South America and Africa. Following crustal separation in the Late Aptian, it evolved into a passive continental margin.
Along the continental margin six basins are recognized, while three onshore basins form part of an aborted rift. Three continental syn-rift stratigraphic sequences are recognized, spanning Jurassic to Barremian times. The Jurassic (Syn-rift I) and Neocomian (Syn-rift {II)} phases were most active in the interior rift basins. During the Barremian (Syn-rift {III)}, rift subsidence rates were twice as large as during the Neocomian (Syn-rift {II)}, both in the interior rift and in the marginal rift segments, indicating that rift axis did not migrate from the interior to the marginal setting.
Rift magmatism was centered on the southern ebris and peaked between 130 and 120 Ma during syn-rift phase {II.} Rift phase {III} was followed by a transitional marine, evaporitic megasequence of Aptian age, which directly overlies the rift unconformity and a marine drift megasequence which spans Albian to Recent times.
During the Late Cretaceous, sedimentation rates responded to first-order eustatic sea-level fluctuations. Tertiary accelerated sedimentation rates can be related to local clastic supply which filled in spaces inherited from previous starved conditions. Between 60 and 40 Ma, post-rift magmatism, centered on the Abrolhos and Royal Charlotte banks, is probably related to development of a hot spot associated with the Vitória-Trindade Seamount Chain.
Although crossing three distinct Precambrian tectono-thermal provinces, ranging from Archean through Late Proterozoic, rift structures follow a general {NE} trend, subparallel to the principal basement fabric. A {NW-SE} oriented stress field appears to be compatible with both Neocomian and Barremian phases of crustal extension.
Profiles transverse to the rift axis indicate crustal stretching factors ranging between [beta] = 2.16 and 2.88. In the shallow portions of the rift, surface extension and crustal thinning seem to be compatible; however, in the deep portions of the basins, this relationship could not be tested.
Reinterpretation of refraction profiles, north and south of the Walvis-São Paulo Ridge transform, indicates that seafloor spreading, from M3 anomaly to Aptian off Pelotas Basin, was taken up by crustal extension in the São Paulo Plateau. Differences in stretching rates may have been accommodated by extension across the Ponta Grossa Arch.
The Early Aptian syn-rift/post-rift transition in the ebris marginal basins does not coincide with the onset of the drift phase during the Early Albian. This apparent discrepancy may be explained by a change from distributed margin-wide extension to a focused mode of extension near the future continent/ocean boundary.},

The control group had no intervention for the 1st hour and then had ice applied for the 2nd hour. Temperatures were continually recorded every minute for 2 hours. The temperature in the treatment group declined significantly, by 2.2 degrees C (95\% confidence interval [-3.6 degrees C, -0.72 degrees C]) over the 1st hour and by 0.79 degrees C (95\% {CI} [-1.8 degrees C, 0.18 degrees C]) over the 2nd hour (P = 0.008).

	abstract = {Phanerozoic rift basin evolution in Africa has been strongly influenced by the pre-existing basement structure inherited from Precambrian tectonics. Two modes of basement reactivation may be identified; the largely dip-slip reactivation of gently dipping shear zone and thrust structures and the largely strike-slip reactivation of steep shear zones and faults. In particular, crustal scale steep basement shear zones have exercised a profound control on rift basin formation on a regional scale. Such shear zone structures are seen to govern the location, trend and structural style of rifts and appear to constrain the orientation of displacements generating the rifts. The shear zones are relatively narrow, high strain zones formed during ductile deformation. They occur as steep, crustal scale ramps that define a pronounced mechanical anisotropy within the African continental crust. These structures are difficult to reactivate by dip-slip movement and thus tend to act as major strike-slip transfer zones during later extensional events. This paper discusses examples of the steep shear zone-rift relationship from three of the rift systems of Africa: the Upper Palaeozoic (Karoo) rifts of Central Africa, the Mesozoic rifts of the Sudan and the Cenozoic rifts of East Africa. These discussions indicate that steep shear zones are sites of rift nucleation and play a fundamental role in the mechanisms of rift propagation and subsequent continental breakup.},

	abstract = {The shear-wave splitting observed along almost all shear-wave ray paths in the Earth's crust is interpreted as the effects of stress-aligned fluid-filled cracks, microcracks, and preferentially oriented pore space. Once away from the free surface, where open joints and fractures may lead to strong anisotropy of 10 per cent or greater, intact ostensibly unfractured crustal rock exhibits a limited range of shear-wave splitting from about 1.5 to 4.5 per cent differential shear-wave velocity anisotropy. Interpreting this velocity anisotropy as normalized crack densities, a factor of less than two in crack radius covers the range from the minimum 1.5 per cent anisotropy observed in intact rock to the 10 per cent observed in heavily cracked almost disaggregated near-surface rocks.
This narrow range of crack dimensions and the pronounced effect on rock cohesion suggests that there is a state of fracture criticality at some level of anisotropy between 4.5 and 10 per cent marking the boundary between essentially intact, and heavily fractured rock. When the level of fracture criticality is exceeded, cracking is so severe that there is a breakdown in shear strength, the likelihood of progressive fracturing and the dispersal of pore fluids through enhanced permeability. The range of normalized crack dimensions below fracture criticality is so small in intact rock, that any modification to the crack geometry by even minor changes of conditions or minor deformation (particularly in the presence of high pore-fluid pressures) may change rock from being essentially intact (below fracture criticality) to heavily fractured (above fracture criticality). This recognition of the essential compliance of most crustal rocks, and its effect on shear-wave splitting, has implications for monitoring changes in any conditions affecting the rock mass. These include monitoring changes in reservoir evolution during hydrocarbon production and enhanced oil recovery, and in monitoring changes before and after earthquakes, amongst others.},

	abstract = {Ice, compression and elevation are the basic principles of acute soft tissue injury. Few clinicians, however, can give specific evidence based guidance on the appropriate duration of each individual treatment session, the frequency of application, or the length of the treatment program. The purpose of this systematic review is to identify the original literature on cryotherapy in acute soft tissue injury and produce evidence based guidance on treatment. A systematic literature search was performed using Medline, Embase, {SportDiscus} and the database of the National Sports Medicine Institute ({UK)} using the key words ice, injury, sport, exercise. Temperature change within the muscle depends on the method of application, duration of application, initial temperature, and depth of subcutaneous fat. The evidence from this systematic review suggests that melting iced water applied through a wet towel for repeated periods of 10 minutes is most effective. The target temperature is reduction of 10-15 degrees C. Using repeated, rather than continuous, ice applications helps sustain reduced muscle temperature without compromising the skin and allows the superficial skin temperature to return to normal while deeper muscle temperature remains low. Reflex activity and motor function are impaired following ice treatment so patients may be more susceptible to injury for up to 30 minutes following treatment. It is concluded that ice is effective, but should be applied in repeated application of 10 minutes to be most effective, avoid side effects, and prevent possible further injury.},

Deviations from this equation are less than ± 2\% with the exception of the high pore aspect ratio St. Peter sandstone, which has a compressional velocity that is 17\% higher than the predicted value. The equation is insensitive to the chemical compostion of the dominant clay mineral and apparently insensitive to the location of the clay grains with respect to the mineral framework, e.g., in free pore space or in contact zones between mineral grains of lower compressibilities.},

Different experimental approaches related to sizes, shapes and density of cracks has been taken into account in earlier investigations. In this paper we present a physical study of shear-wave splitting in anisotropy induced aligned cracked media. In this experiment, rubber discs were used as inclusions in a solid epoxy resin matrix. Pulse transmission measurements were carried out on a reference model (without inclusions) and two other models with different aperture of cracks and dissimilar crack densities. The seismic records were measured using three different S-wave source transducers with dominant frequency of 0.1 {MHz} (low frequency), 0.5 {MHz} (intermediate frequency) and 1 {MHz} (high frequency). Crack apertures to seismic wavelength ratio were varied from 1.3 to 13.3 in one model and 2.3 to 23.5 in the second cracked model. Our results show that effects associated with acoustic scattering, attenuation and velocity dispersion interfere directly in shear wave splitting, which in turn is a function of crack aperture and source frequency.},

Rock stress is a difficult quantity to estimate because the rock stress measuring techniques consist of perturbing the rock, measuring displacements or hydraulic parameters, and converting the measured quantities into rock stresses. There are two main types of method: those that disturb the in situ rock conditions, i.e. by inducing strains, deformations or crack opening pressures; and those that are based on observation of rock behaviour without any major influence from the measuring method. The most common methods are briefly described including their application areas and limiting factors.},

The data weighting and smoothing method presented here in theory and practice is developed on the basis of a statistical smoothing algorithm. The method can be applied to orientation data of 180\{degrees\} periodicity such as maximum horizontal tectonic stresses ({SH)} as compiled in the World Stress Map database. Our smoothing algorithm enables discrimination between local ({\textless}250 km of lateral extent) and regional (c. 250-5000 km of lateral extent) stress fields, and allows comparison of {SH} with other directional data such as fault trends or strain data. We present smoothed stress maps for northeastern America, the Himalayas and western Europe. By varying the scale and smoothing parameters we illustrate their influence on the accuracy and smoothness. We give recommendations for the appropriate choice of these parameters.},

	abstract = {Seismicity and stresses along the Brazilian continental margin show different patterns between the northeastern and southeastern regions. In the northeastern margin, earthquakes tend to occur onshore under a strike-slip regime with horizontal compression parallel to the northern coast line. In the southeastern margin, higher seismicity is observed offshore, in areas where the continental crust was highly extended during the South Atlantic rifting in the Mesozoic. Three new events in the southeast continental shelf are shown to have reverse-faulting mechanisms, from waveform modeling of short-period teleseismic P waves. Multiple depth phases (reflections from the top and bottom of the water layer and double reflections in the water layer) could be identified and better constrained the hypocenters to middle and upper crustal depths. In South America, models of intraplate stresses caused by plate boundary forces and spreading effects due to the continental/oceanic crustal transition indicate higher compressional stresses in the {SE} offshore area, as compared with the continental area, in agreement with the observed higher seismicity and reverse-faulting mechanisms. The combination of regional stresses, local flexural effects from thick sedimentary loads, and a presumably weaker crust from Mesozoic thinning explains the main patterns of seismicity in the northeastern and southeastern Brazilian margins.},

	doi = {10.1144/GSL.SP.2003.209.01.16},
	abstract = {The ability to numerically model single-phase and multiphase flow of fluids in porous or fractured media is extremely important in developing an understanding of the complex phenomena governing the flow. The flow is complicated by the presence of heterogeneities in the reservoir at many different length scales by special flow features such as fractures or faults and by phenomena such as diffusion and dispersion. These effects must be effectively modelled by terms in coupled systems of non-linear partial differential equations which form the basis of the simulator. The simulator must be able to model both single and multiphase flows and the transition regimes between the two in unsaturated flow applications. A discussion of some of the aspects of modelling unsaturated and multiphase flows in the presence of heterogeneities and severe channelling is presented along with directions for future work. Simulators are severely hampered by the lack of knowledge of reservoir properties, heterogeneities, fracture dimension and orientation, and relevant length scales and other important mechanisms. Simulations can be performed either deterministically, to predict the outcome of a single realization of reservoir and flow properties, or via stochastic techniques to incorporate uncertainties of flow directly. Due to the extreme difficulties in using stochastic differential equation models for non-linear multiphase flows, we will concentrate on the potential of deterministic models. Recent developments have been made in homogenization, scaled averaging, and the use of the simulator as an experimental tool to develop methods to model the interrelations between localized and larger-scale media effects. Monte Carlo techniques using simulators with effective parameters can generate statistics for multiphase flow.},

	abstract = {A magma-driven rifting episode occurred at the Harrat Lunayyir (Harrat Al-shaqa) volcanic field, western Arabia, between 2009 April and July. It was accompanied by a swarm of more than 4000 M \&gt; 2 earthquakes, the largest ever documented in that region, with a peak Mw 5.7 shock on May 19. We combine Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar ({InSAR)} measurements and elastic modelling with seismic moment calculations to resolve the evolution of surface deformation associated with this event. Phase discontinuities and low-coherence lineaments are used to infer the location of the main active structures during the various deformation stages and descending-track interferograms that span the entire period are inverted to resolve the slip and opening distributions along two graben-bounding normal faults and a dyke, respectively. Assuming negligible rift-parallel displacements, we combine ascending- and descending-track interferograms to derive the vertical and rift-perpendicular deformation, which add up to a maximum surface extension of 1.5 m across the rift and subsidence of 0.8 m. The far-field deformation is dominated by the dyke opening, whereas the near-field displacements are mostly associated with movements along the faults. The cumulative seismic moment released during the entire swarm period accounts for about 14 per cent of the total geodetic moment, compared to about 55 per cent at the 2007 Gelai (Tanzania) and about 8 per cent at the 2005 Manda {Hararo2013Dabbahu} (Afar) events. We propose that the differences in moment partitioning ratios are due to the different crustal and seismogenic layer thicknesses in the three regions and represent different stages in the evolution of a volcanic rift. The Gelai event represents the most juvenile stage of rifting, the Dabbahu event represents the most evolved and the Harrat Lunayyir event represents a rift that is intermediate between the two in its degree of maturity.},

	abstract = {Tight gas reservoirs house a vast resource of natural gas, in excess of 1,000 Tcf of gas. The ability to find and map open, natural fractures in advance of drilling represents the major challenge for future development of these low permeability reservoirs. To further the development of fracture detection technologies, a joint {R\&D} and field demonstration effort involving {DOE/METC}, Barrett Resources and Advanced Resources International was established. The technical approach is to start with the use of low cost regional reconnaissance methods to locate subtle basement structures that cause overlying sediments to fracture. High-resolution aeromagnetic data (2,500 mi $^{\textrm{2}}$ ) were acquired to delineate basement geometry. Remote sensing imagery analysis was used in conjunction with 400 line-miles of 2-D seismic to provide consistency of interpretation. The integrated geologic study revealed that the basin structural fabric was dominated by a series of large northwest trending reactivated basement features. Northwest aligned natural gas production trends confirmed the importance of basement features for causing natural fractures and high productivity fairways. In April 1996, a 4.5 mi $^{\textrm{2}}$ 3-D multiazimuth P-wave reflection study was acquired to target subsurface fracture sets. The 3-D survey is full-azimuth, full-offset designed to evaluate P-wave azimuthal anisotropy. For offset amplitude variation with azimuth processing, we identified the fast velocity and therefore open fracture orientation as N30 degrees W consistent with the integrated geologic prediction. Mapped amplitude anomalies have been interpreted as subsurface open fracture clusters. A six-well program, starting in October 1996, is being located to target the amplitude anomalies and will be used to verify commercial viability of this newly developed natural fracture detection technology.},

Anisotropic phenomena are comparatively common, and it is the intention of this review to present these developments to a wider audience. Few of the results are new, but the opportunity is taken to tidy up a few loose ends, and present consistent theoretical formulations for the numerical solution of a number of propagation problems. Such numerical experiments have played a large part in our increasing understanding of wave motion in anisotropic media. It now appears that the solution of most problems in anisotropic propagation can be formulated, if the corresponding solution exists for isotropic propagation, and may be solved at the cost of considerably more numerical computation.
There are two significant results from these developments: the recognition of the importance of body- and surface-wave polarizations in diagnosing and estimating anisotropy; and the recognition that many two-phase materials, particularly cracked solids, can be modelled by anisotropic elastic-constants. This last result opens up a new class of materials to wave-motion analysis, and has applications in a variety of different fields.},

	abstract = {The dynamic nature of the Earth's stress field is a result of tectonism, uplift and extension. However, stress-induced phenomena are also influenced and complicated by remnant stress-history effects. The resultant intrinsic anisotropic sedimentary layers present within the Earth allow their interpretation using the seismic reflection and transmission methods. Interpretation objectives include the determination of hydrocarbon reservoirs, fracture presence/orientation, and in situ stress directionality. Stress has the potential to affect most petrophysical rock properties. The effects of stress history on the acoustic and elastic properties of artificially manufactured sandstones have been investigated using ultrasonic techniques. Homogeneous mixtures of quartz sand and epoxy resin were allowed to harden under the application of different forming stress magnitudes. This was followed by unloading under anisotropic stress conditions satisfying uniaxial strain criteria. The resultant sandstones exhibited azimuthal velocity, amplitude and Poisson's ratio changes with a 90-degree periodicity. Pronounced, well-defined shear-wave splitting was also prevalent. As the manufacturing (forming) stress was increased the average velocity of all body waves decreased, attenuation increased and the percentage anisotropy increased. The azimuthal anisotropy was consistent with the symmetry of anisotropic stresses during unloading. The acoustic trend supported the concept of shear-wave splitting resulting from the formation of intergranular microcracks in the plane orthogonal to the maximum stress during unloading. As the forming stress was increased, so too did the length of the unloading path. This in turn induced a higher density of aligned microcracks, inducing a larger, controllable, acoustic anisotropy. This method requires little more than a car jack and ultrasonic transducers. It is a method to provide useful knowledge of the effects on seismic wave propagation as a result of varying rock matrix parameters. These developments offer a new approach to research into stress-induced phenomena and their implications for seismic interpretation.},

Our conclusions are based on current seismicity, digital topography, fission-track ages, gravity data, regional reflection seismic profiles, and well data. Our results have important implications for risk factors associated with deep-water exploration plays, especially the prolific Early Cretaceous lacustrine petroleum system of the Campos and Santos basins. Onshore, widespread crustal seismicity indicates a current transpressional stress regime. The Moho is 37-42 km deep, and neotectonic fault-block tilting has resulted in mountain ranges up to 2700 m high and extensive river capture. Based on fission-track data, the mountains were exhumed in the Cretaceous and Eocene. A series of Tertiary continental pull-apart basins, developed during Paleogene right-lateral transtension, became inverted during Neogene right-lateral transpression. Late Cretaceous-Paleogene alkaline intrusions, attributable to the Trindade hot spot, were emplaced along reactivated Neocomian strike-slip faults and transfer zones. Offshore, current seismicity is widespread across the continental margin. The locus of clastic fan deposition shifted during the Late Cretaceous and Tertiary because of onshore block faulting and drainage reorganization. Cretaceous sedimentary rocks were folded, tilted, eroded, and unconformably onlapped above an inferred Neocomian Moho uplift to produce an accentuated nearshore hinge line. Neocomian transfer zones were reactivated during ongoing sedimentation, accompanied by abundant volcanism and deep-seated folds attributed to lithospheric buckling. In the Campos area, a coastal salient was uplifted and turbidites were redeposited. In general, regional tilting resulted in thin-skinned deformation above Aptian salt.},

	abstract = {The upper Green River Formation at the Bluebell-Altamont Field, Utah (Figure 1) is a tight gas sand reservoir where economic production can be sustained only in regions of high natural fracturing. In 1994, a demonstration seismic project was conducted at the field to show how exploration for, and the characterization of, naturally fractured gas reservoirs can be more effective through the integrated use of seismic techniques. Study of field exposures, well logs, and regional stress indicators prior to the seismic survey indicated a high degree of preferential orientation to the dominant fracture trend at the field. The seismic survey consisted of two crossing, nine-component surface seismic lines and a nine-component vertical seismic profile. The compression, and shear-wave surface seismic both recorded anisotropies that were related to the presence and azimuth of the natural fracturing. The surface seismic results were supported by results from the nine-component vertical seismic profile. This program demonstrates the potential offered by the use of integrated seismic and geological techniques for the analysis of both land and marine naturally fractured reservoirs; furthermore, it demonstrates the possibilities of reviewing existing databases containing compression-wave surface seismic data for fracture information.},

	note = {Nos reservatórios de hidrocarbonetos, a caracterização das falhas e fraturas é de extrema importância devido a seu papel ora como barreiras ao fluxo, ora canais condutores. Os efeitos da anisotropia causada por fraturas alinhadas têm sido objeto de muitos trabalhos e experimentos de modelagem sísmica. No entanto, devido a complexidade exibida por meios fraturados anisotrópicos, a caracterização desse tipo de meio nem sempre é possível. Nestas condições, através da adoção de modelos e geometrias simplificados, bem como da adequada escolha dos parâmetros é que a modelagem física da propagação de ondas sísmicas através de meios fraturados permite estimar a influência destas características das fraturas de forma mais confiável. Modelamos fraturas preenchidas por material de baixa resistência ao cisalhamento usando inclusões de neoprene, que possui esta característica. Foram efetuadas medidas de transmissão acústica de ondas P e S em um modelo de referência sem inclusões e em outro modelo com inclusões discóides de neoprene. Os dados ultrassônicos foram adquiridos usando transdutores de ondas P com frequência central de 120 {kHz} e de ondas S com 90 {kHz.} Estudamos o comportamento destes dois meios anisotrópicos sob compressão uniaxial. Também estudamos o efeito destas inclusões sobre os parâmetros anisotrópicos de um meio cujo arcabouço já apresentava comportamento anisotrópico polar. Ambos os modelos foram submetidos a compressão uniaxial com tensões de 3 até 15,8 {MPa.} O completo fechamento das fraturas ocorre ao nível de tensão de 14,6 {MPa.} Nossa análise aponta a existência de diferentes regimes para o comportamento das inclusões, observados tanto no parâmetro densidade de fraturas quanto sob sua razão de aspecto. Estes resultados sugerem uma dependência da razão de aspecto para baixos níveis de tensão uniaxial diferente do que se tem reportado na literatura. Outros resultados obtidos dizem respeito à caracterização dos meios anisotrópicos devido ao fraturamento a partir dos coeficientes elásticos derivados a partir das velocidades sísmicas. Apesar de não exaustivos, nossos resultados mostram que abordagens experimentais simples podem fornecer conhecimento valioso do comportamento de rochas fraturadas aos níveis de tensão existentes nos reservatórios.

Theoretical developments of Hudson demonstrate how to calculate the variations of velocity and attenuation of seismic waves propagating through solids containing aligned cracks. The analysis can handle a wide variety of crack configurations and crack geometries. Hudson associates the velocity variations with effective elastic constants. In this paper we associate the variation of attenuation with the imaginary parts of complex effective elastic constants. These complex elastic constants permit the simulation of wave propagation through two-phase materials by the calculation of wave propagation through homogeneous anisotropic solids.},

	abstract = {Knowledge of the spacing and size of discontinuities in a rock mass is of considerable importance for the prediction of rock behaviour. The characteristics of discontinuities can be estimated using scanline surveys but the precision of the estimates must be obtained and the bias caused by linear sampling must be eliminated before they can validly be used. Initially, an expression is presented which gives the degree of confidence that can be assigned to the measured mean discontinuity spacing. A reduced form of this expression is obtained for cases where the discontinuity spacings follow the negative exponential distribution. The precision of discontinuity frequency and {RQD} estimates is also explained. The distribution of trace lengths produced by the intersection of planar discontinuities with a planar rock face is used to determine the distribution of trace lengths, the distribution of semi-trace lengths and the distribution of censored semi-trace lengths intersected by a randomly located scanline. Comparison of the actual and sampled distributions demonstrates the bias introduced by scanline sampling of trace lengths. Relations between the distributions can be used to produce analytical or graphical methods of estimating mean trace length from censored measurements at exposures of limited extent.},

The subjects were randomly divided between a placebo group (n = 8) and the l-Arg/l-Orn-supplemented group (n = 9), and performed pre and posttraining standard exercise tests with the same absolute load, which consisted of the same exercise schedule as that applied in the training process. Fasting blood samples were obtained at rest, 2 minutes after the cessation of the strength exercise protocol, and after 1 hour of recovery. The resting concentrations of the investigated hormones and {IGFBP-3} did not differ significantly between the study groups. In response to exercise test, all the hormones were elevated (p {\textless} 0.05) at both time points. Significant increases (p {\textless} 0.05) were observed in both {GH} and {IGF-1} serum levels after arg and orn supplementation at both time points, whereas a significant decrease was seen in {IGFBP-3} protein during the recovery period. Because there was no between-group difference in the remaining hormone levels, it appears that the {GH/IGF-1/IGFBP-3} complex may be the major player in muscle tissue response to short-term resistance training after arg and orn supplementation.},

	abstract = {Prospective hydrocarbon-bearing zones in the subject gas shale are characterized by gas entrapped in the sediment matrix with some additional openfracture component. This gas is economically recovered by horizontal drilling and fracturing. However, well placement close to faults is a significant risk factor due to expected mineralization of the fault and nearby shales and due to the risk of any fracture completions being “captured” by nearby faults. A wide azimuth {3D} survey was acquired to highlight areas exhibiting seismic velocity anisotropy for detection of open fractures. Sweet spots would be areas of anomalously low Poisson's ratio ({PR)}, away from faults, with (in this particular shale) high velocity anisotropy. This study documents the results of an integrated workflow of data processing, pre-stack seismic inversion and Ant Tracking to successfully characterize faults and fractures and to identify sweet spots in the subject gas shale. During data processing, azimuthal anisotropy analysis was done to determine the dominant direction of Vfast and Vslow. In general, there is good agreement between the azimuthal seismic data processing velocity analysis and Ant Tracking results. Corrections for {HTI} medium were applied prior to {VTI} anisotropic Kirchhoff prestack time migration ({KPSTM).} Two full azimuth {3D} seismic volumes were created: a prestack volume as input for inversion and a stacked volume as input for Ant Tracking. Simultaneous {AVO} inversion was done on prestack data to invert for acoustic impedance (Al) and Poisson's ratio ({PR).} A blind test of the inverted attributes is very encouraging. Areas of low {PR} away from faults are thought to be promising hydrocarbon leads or prospects. Ant Tracking reduces the risk of drilling near faults by providing a high resolution image of fractures and faults beyond what can be interpreted from conventional seismic data. The resulting integration of Poisson's ratio, anisotropy, and Ant Tracking results provide effective delineation of areas with superior porosity/charge, areas with open fractures, and areas with faulting, outlining likely sweet spots as well as areas better avoided in drilling.},

	abstract = {Background: Individuals who sustain a rupture of the anterior cruciate ligament ({ACL)} are at an increased risk for developing early-onset knee osteoarthritis ({OA).} The mechanism behind the early onset of the disease is still unknown. Knee {OA} progression has been previously examined by calculating the internal knee-abduction moment during gait. However, knee-joint moments have not been examined in individuals after {ACL} reconstruction as a potential mechanism for disease progression in early knee {OA.} Objective: To determine if individuals who have undergone {ACL} reconstruction exhibit altered gait mechanics that may be associated with knee {OA} progression. Methods: In total, 17 people who had previously undergone {ACL} reconstruction were enrolled in the study. A matched control group was recruited for comparison. All participants underwent gait analysis at an intentional walking speed to examine variables previously associated with knee {OA} progression, primarily the internal peak knee-abduction moment, during gait. One way {ANOVAs} were performed to examine differences in gait mechanics between the two groups. All joint moments were calculated as internal moments. Results: The peak knee-abduction moment was increased by 21\% in the {ACL} compared with the control group (p = 0.04). No other differences were seen in frontal plane knee or hip mechanics. Conclusion: It seems that individuals who have undergone {ACL} reconstruction exhibit an increased peak knee-abduction moment that may establish a potential mechanism of the earlier onset of knee {OA} in this population.},

	abstract = {One of the fields in the Norwegian Sea has been imaged several times over the past decades, both with conventional narrow azimuth seismic surveys as well as with ocean bottom seismic. The extensively faulted structure of the field and the possible presence of a salt diapir cause imaging problems in some areas. Therefore, a simulation study has been initiated to judge whether or not a marine full azimuth acquisition geometry improves the image of the subsurface. For this simulation study, simplified velocity and density models of the field were created, containing the main features characterizing it, as well as the problem areas. The simulation was done with {3D} finite difference ({FD)} modeling. Data sets with and without free surface multiples were generated, and imaging from a full azimuth acquisition geometry was compared with imaging from a conventional narrow azimuth geometry. {FD} modeling shows that the full azimuth design generally leads to a better suppression of noise in the data, mainly due to increased fold. Depth slices show that fault edges are imaged sharper in a full azimuth geometry. Also, the image of and below the salt/limestone structure is improved. However, attenuation of multiple energy due to increased cross line fold is less than expected, except for the first seabed multiple. The low maximum frequency used in {FD-modeling} may have limited the increase in image quality with the full azimuth modeling.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.tecto.2009.08.023},
	abstract = {Deformation processes in sediments at accretionary prisms are directly controlled by the state of effective in situ stress, the mechanical-, physical- and geochemical properties of the materials of the fault zone and surrounding wall rocks, as well as time. Measurements of these properties and their evolution in space and time, are therefore needed for a full understanding of the process of earthquake generation within subduction zones.
Reconsolidation tests have been carried out on Ocean Drilling Program cores collected from a reference site seaward of the active Nankai décollement zone off the southeast coast of Japan. The reconsolidation stress path subjects the samples to uniaxial strain deformation, which mimics their stress history, however at much higher loading rates than in the natural system. We have conducted two tests each from two mudstone samples within Lower Shikoku Basin. The samples were collected at 361 and 476 m below seafloor, on either side of the protodécollement horizon.
The objectives for mechanical testing are to probe the yield- and failure surfaces of these shallow sediments ({\textless} 0.5 km depth), and to project their mechanical properties from shallow to greater depths (several kilometers depth). This information is useful for making predictions about sediment response to accretion, underplating, and slip along the décollement. Because the tests were executed with a stress path that may approximate the stress history of the test samples, an additional objective is to estimate the effective in situ vertical stress, and to constrain the pore-fluid pressure at sample depth.
Considering their large scale behavior, our tests show that the samples collected above the protodécollement have higher strength than those below. We propose that cementation, microfabric and mineralogy of the sediments above the protodécollement result in a higher effective yield stress than predicted from effective in situ vertical stress at hydrostatic pore pressures. Sediments below the protodécollement, in contrast, are slightly underconsolidated, and provide an upper constraint on the magnitude of effective in situ vertical stress and pore-fluid pressure. We also used the test results to make initial predictions for the yield surface in {2D} and {3D} for sub-décollement samples across the margin. The construction of the {2D} yield surface is the first attempt to quantify the model of sediment deformation proposed by Morgan et al. (2007). These results hint that the presence of cement has a strong, and increasing, influence on sediment behavior. Further testing is needed to verify these findings.},

	abstract = {The use of cryotherapy, i.e. the application of cold for the treatment of injury or disease, is widespread in sports medicine today. It is an established method when treating acute soft tissue injuries, but there is a discrepancy between the scientific basis for cryotherapy and clinical studies. Various methods such as ice packs, ice towels, ice massage, gel packs, refrigerant gases and inflatable splints can be used. Cold is also used to reduce the recovery time as part of the rehabilitation programme both after acute injuries and in the treatment of chronic injuries. Cryotherapy has also been shown to reduce pain effectively in the post-operative period after reconstructive surgery of the joints. Both superficial and deep temperature changes depend on the method of application, initial temperature and application time. The physiological and biological effects are due to the reduction in temperature in the various tissues, together with the neuromuscular action and relaxation of the muscles produced by the application of cold. Cold increases the pain threshold, the viscosity and the plastic deformation of the tissues but decreases the motor performance. The application of cold has also been found to decrease the inflammatory reaction in an experimental situation. Cold appears to be effective and harmless and few complications or side-effects after the use of cold therapy are reported. Prolonged application at very low temperatures should, however, be avoided as this may cause serious side-effects, such as frost-bite and nerve injuries. Practical applications, indications and contraindications are discussed.},

Because of this it is often difficult to determine the fluid pathway through a particular fracture system even when the geometry of the network is known. Although many fluids (e.g. gas, water etc.) leave little or no evidence of their passage through the rock others such as magmas and fluidized sediments preserve the pathways they follow by forming dykes and sills. It is found that the pathways preserved by the two types of fluids are different i.e. the spacing of the clastic dykes follows a power-law distribution and that of the igneous dykes a log-normal distribution. It is suggested that this in part might reflect the different properties of the dyke material (specifically its permeability) which determines whether or not the fracture containing the dyke can continue to act as a channel of easy fluid migration once the dyke has been emplaced.},

	abstract = {A shear-wave (S-wave) {VSP} experiment was performed at Lost Hills Field, California, in an attempt to detect hydraulic fractures induced in a nearby well. The hydrofrac well was located between an impulsive, S-wave source on the surface and a receiver well containing a clamped, three-component geophone. Both direct and scattered waves were detected immediately after shut-in, when the hydraulic pumps were shut off and recording started. The scattered energy disappeared within about an hour, which is consistent with other measurements that indicate some degree of fracture closure and leak-off within that {period.Although} S-wave splitting was evident, no change was detected in the fast wave (polarized parallel to the fracture). However, the slow wave (polarized perpendicular to the fracture) did change over a period of about an hour, after which the prehydrofrac wavelet shape was recovered. The fact that only the wave polarized perpendicular to the fracture was affected is a dramatic confirmation of both theoretical predictions and laboratory observations of S-wave behavior in a fractured {medium.Subtracting} the prehydrofrac wavelet from the wavelets recorded within the first hour after shut-in revealed scattered wavelets that were diminished and phase-rotated versions of the incident (prehydrofrac) wavelet. Arrival times of the direct and scattered waves were matched by ray tracing. We accounted for the scattered-wave amplitudes by using numerical solutions of S-wave diffractions off of ribbon-shaped fractures. Amplitudes derived from full-wavefield Born scattering, however, did not match recorded amplitudes. The phase of the scattered wavelets was matched very well by Born scattering when the incident wavelet was input, but only for fracture lengths no larger than half those predicted from fracture-simulator models. These results show that a carefully controlled experiment, combined with accurate modeling, can provide important information about the geometry of induced fractures.},

For liquid-saturated rocks, the poroelastic coupling parameter usually lies between 0.1 and 1.0, which means that the mechanical deformation has a strong influence on the pore pressure. The thermoelastic coupling parameter is usually very small, so that, although the temperature field influences the stresses and strains, the stresses and strains do not appreciably influence the temperature field.},

	abstract = {Nutrient timing is a popular nutritional strategy that involves the consumption of combinations of nutrients--primarily protein and carbohydrate--in and around an exercise session. Some have claimed that this approach can produce dramatic improvements in body composition. It has even been postulated that the timing of nutritional consumption may be more important than the absolute daily intake of nutrients. The post-exercise period is widely considered the most critical part of nutrient timing. Theoretically, consuming the proper ratio of nutrients during this time not only initiates the rebuilding of damaged muscle tissue and restoration of energy reserves, but it does so in a supercompensated fashion that enhances both body composition and exercise performance. Several researchers have made reference to an anabolic “window of opportunity” whereby a limited time exists after training to optimize training-related muscular adaptations. However, the importance - and even the existence - of a post-exercise ‘window’ can vary according to a number of factors. Not only is nutrient timing research open to question in terms of applicability, but recent evidence has directly challenged the classical view of the relevance of post-exercise nutritional intake with respect to anabolism. Therefore, the purpose of this paper will be twofold: 1) to review the existing literature on the effects of nutrient timing with respect to post-exercise muscular adaptations, and; 2) to draw relevant conclusions that allow practical, evidence-based nutritional recommendations to be made for maximizing the anabolic response to exercise.

Laurentia and Baltica distanced themselves from Gondwana by moving out of the Rodinian cratonal cluster. West Gondwana, of which Avalon was a part during the late Proterozoic to Cambrian cratonal assembly, consisted mainly of Africa and South America.
The main geological evidence is presented for: (1) a transition from continental platform conditions to those of a subduction-related volcanic arc regime in Late Proterozoic time during the dispersal of the Rodinian supercontinent, and the resulting assembly of the Gondwanan supercontinent; and (2) a second transition that marked a reversal from the volcanic arc regime to marine platformal environments by early Cambrian time.
Evidence for progressive instability of the continental shelf margining the Rodinian supercontinent is contained in late Proterozoic olistostromes, mylonite zones, calc-alkaline magmatism, and arc-derived clastic rocks, some being glacigenic, during three phases of the Avalonian orogeny.
By early Cambrian time the reversal from a tectonically unstable volcanic arc regime to more stable platformal conditions took place as Avalon, Armorica and related microcontinental blocks rifted from Gondwana. These Gondwanan fragments sequentially come into collision, first with each other and Baltica, and then with Laurentia in Mid to Late Paleozoic time as Pangaea was being assembled.},

The main kinds of structures described involve sets of repeated secondary fractures (striated or not) which intersect the slip plane in a direction roughly perpendicular to the slip direction. Some of the most frequent criteria are new; their reliability is established in the field and by comparison with both previous and new experiments. It is shown that some of the rarer structures probably correspond to neo-rupture in intact rock, most probably at the tip of pre-existing joints, while the most frequent structures are generated by friction on joints, with very little sliding. The possible seismic origin of some structures is discussed.},

	abstract = {To gain insight into the formation and distribution of joints and faults and to illuminate the origin of associated secondary structures, we have developed methods for the interactive calculation and visualization of the stresses and displacements around these features. We assume that joints and faults can be idealized as cracks in homogeneous elastic bodies. Linear elastic fracture mechanics ({LEFM)} provides analytical expressions for the stress and displacement fields around cracks of various geometries for various loading conditions. We use a widely available symbolic math program to solve the general equations for a crack under uniform remote load and to display the results in two and three dimensions.
Fracture mechanics has wide application in structural geology. The linked graphics and mathematics capabilities of symbolic math packages make {LEFM} accessible to a wide audience for both analytical and heuristic applications. We offer several geologic examples to demonstrate the power of visualizing the analytical solutions to linear elastic fracture problems. By examining the stress pattern around a modeled strike-slip fault we can predict the expression of secondary structures around the fault, including basins and ridges, or splay cracks and pressure solution surfaces. An analysis of variation in tensile stress away from an existing joint can be used to predict where the next parallel joint might initiate, defining the relationship between bed thickness and joint spacing. The crack model of a simple strike-slip fault also yields displacement vectors comparable in direction and relative magnitude to measured displacements produced by the 1989 Loma Prieta (California) earthquake.},

Our interpretation is based on published literature, Bouguer-corrected gravity, regional reflection seismic profiles, and well data. In the Santos and Campos basins, Neocomian rift architecture was strongly influenced by preexisting fabric and structures of the Late Proterozoic (Brasiliano orogeny). The Atlantic margin inherited an east-northeast-west-southwest orientation so that rifting was oblique to the margin. On a regional map of Bouguer-corrected gravity, a nearshore belt of positive anomalies correlates with an interpreted broad Moho uplift in the footwall of Neocomian extensional faults. Farther offshore, a second belt of positive anomalies correlates with a presalt ridge of eroded volcanic or basement anticlines covered by thin Aptian evaporites, interpreted as a failed spreading center. Intervening negative anomalies coincide with the main rift basin. All three belts show apparent offsets along linear zones trending west-northwest-east-southeast, which we interpret as transfer zones. The vergence of half rifts tends to change across transfer zones, compartmentalizing the rifted margin into subbasins. Our results have implications for the risks associated with distribution, maturation, and migration of hydrocarbons within the prolific Early Cretaceous lacustrine petroleum system of the Campos and Santos basins.},

The Pilot Hole intersected numerous macroscopic fractures and faults with extremely varied orientations. Despite the highly variable orientation of the fractures and faults, the fast polarization direction of the shear waves is very consistent with the direction of maximum horizontal compression determined from wellbore breakouts and drilling induced tensile fractures. At least three major shear zones were intersected by the borehole that are characterized by anomalously low velocity and resistivity, anomalously high shear velocity anisotropy and an absence of stress-induced wellbore breakouts (which suggests anomalously low differential stress). We argue that the physical mechanism responsible for the seismic velocity anisotropy observed in the Pilot Hole is the preferential closure of fractures in response to an anisotropic stress state.},

This paper summarizes and discusses the mechanisms proposed to explain the low apparent friction of crustal-scale faults with low resolved shear stresses. Emphasis is placed on differentiating static weakening mechanisms, operating at strain rates c. 10-12 s-1-10-15 s-1, from dynamic weakening mechanisms, operating at strain rates {\textgreater}10-1 s-1. Previous published explanations for low fault friction do not appear to meet the key requirements of (i) reducing both static and dynamic frictional strength of {LANF} and (ii) operating only along crustal-scale faults. Fault rock assemblages in quartzo-feldspathic continental crust reveal that grain size reduction, or comminution, plays a fundamental role in fault zone development. As a fault accrues displacement, a fault core forms that contains granular material. We postulate that dynamic rock fragmentation occurs during the shearing of confined granular material; dynamic fragmentation is a volume-dependent mechanism responsible for reducing the static and dynamic frictional strengths of faults.},

	abstract = {To investigate the question of how faults affect the migration of fluids in petroleum reservoirs, we evaluated the state of stress and pore pressure acting on the major faults in four oil and gas fields in the northern North Sea. Many of the faults bound hydrocarbon reservoirs. Our goal was to test the hypothesis that faults that are being reactivated in the current stress field are permeable and thus tend to leak, whereas those that are not (i.e. faults that are inactive in the current stress field) are likely to seal. To address this question, we utilize a detailed analysis of the magnitude and orientation of all three principal stresses in a number of wells in each field. These data, along with information on pore pressure, allowed us to resolve the shear and effective normal stress acting on distinct 100 m × 100 m elements of individual fault planes. By comparing the stress state resolved on each fault element to expected stress at failure (using a Coulomb failure criterion) we created color-shaded maps showing the proximity to fault slip (and hence leakage) along each fault. Fault reactivation and hydrocarbon leakage in this area appears to be caused by three factors: (1) locally elevated pore pressure due to buoyant hydrocarbons in reservoirs abutting the faults, (2) fault orientations that are nearly optimally oriented for frictional slip in the present-day stress field, and (3) a relatively recent perturbation of the compressional stress caused by postglacial rebound. We demonstrate that the combination of these three factors may have recently induced fault slippage and gas leakage along sections of previously sealing reservoir-bounding faults in some fields, whereas in others, the stress and pore pressure are not sufficient to cause fault reactivation. We show that only in cases where reservoir-bounding faults are not potentially active, the pore-pressure difference across faults can become quite high. Hence, the leakage potential of reservoir-bounding faults appears to exert an important influence on potential hydrocarbon column heights.},

More recently, a stress-related closure of soft pores with a narrow distribution of compliances (e.g. grain contacts) has been suggested to be sufficient to explain such exponential stress dependency. This theoretical interpretation has been verified here using laboratory measurements on dry sandstones. On the basis of these experimental data, linear dependency of elastic compressibility on soft porosity and exponential decay of soft porosity and elastic compressibility with effective stress up to 60 {MPa} is confirmed. Soft porosity, estimated from the fitting coefficients of elastic compressibilities, is on the same order of magnitude but slightly lower than obtained from strain measurements. The results confirm applicability of the previously proposed stress sensitivity model and provide justification for using this approach to model stress dependency of elastic properties.},

Inside this clayey core, a clear shearing surface with marked slip lines is visible on a plane that makes a 68° angle with respect to the core axis. This failure surface was not induced by the decompression process but is indeed a slip plane as clear striation is observed at the interface. On the basis of an elasto-plastic constitutive model calibrated on triaxial tests on the clayey gouge, it is shown that shear band formation inside the clayey core is possible. The solution for the orientation of the shear band is compared to the orientation of an existing slip surface inside the clayey gouge and this result is used to deduce the orientation of the principal stresses. It is shown that as commonly observed in weak fault zones, the orientation of the principal stresses is locally almost parallel and perpendicular to the fault axis.},

	abstract = {Petrophysical parameters such as permeability and geophysical measurements such as sound velocity and attenuation are known to depend on porosity and the distribution of fractures. This research has investigated the effect of lithological parameters on fracture distribution and acoustic properties of synthetic sandstone core. The primary objective of this research was to develop a greater understanding of the relationships between fractures and petrophysical and geophysical parameters. The anisotropic properties observed were solely attributed to aligned fractures, which were observed both macroscopically and microscopically, with no evidence of grain alignment. Fractures within the synthetic sandstones were controlled by forming the core under a range of known forming stresses, and after relaxation, studying the effects of the induced fracture system using petrophysical and acoustic techniques. The results are presented using azimuthal velocity, directional permeability, shear-wave splitting and microscopy data. The artificial cores all displayed acoustic anisotropy consistent with the symmetry of the forming stresses, which is related to the opening of fractures primarily oriented normal to the minor principal stress during relaxation.},

	abstract = {The classical theory for hydraulic fracturing stress measurements assumes an ideal case with a linear elastic, homogenous, and isotropic medium; and a fracture that reopens distinctly when the minimum tangential borehole stress is exceeded. The induced fracture disturbs this ideal picture in several aspects, which are important for the evaluation of the maximum horizontal principal stress using the fracture reopening pressure. This disturbance can be attributed to the fracture normal stiffness and the initial hydraulic fracture permeability. In this paper, the hydraulic fracturing reopening test is studied by coupled hydromechanical modeling that takes into account an induced fracture that is incompletely closed. The result shows that with realistic equipment compliance, the apparent fracture reopening evaluated from the well-pressure is close to the magnitude of the minimum horizontal principal stress with little or no correlation to the maximum horizontal principal stress. This observation suggests that the determination of maximum principal stress by hydraulic fracturing using the reopening pressure is very uncertain.},

A study on the effect of elastic anisotropy on underground excavations reveals that this effect is actually controlled by the imposed boundary conditions. Applications to tunneling and to the Underground Research Laboratory ({URL)}, Canada, exemplify a procedure for boundary condition estimation formerly developed by the authors. In this procedure, previous information is accounted for, so that boundary conditions can be updated at the various stages of a project, as soon as new information becomes available; strain, stress, or displacement measurement can be used as input data. The procedure displayed fast convergence despite the complex geometry, and the high degree of non-linearity of the models. The application to the two-dimensional (2-D) plane strain synthetic model of a tunnel in a yielding rock mass shows the need to use absolute displacements (rather than relative displacements) in order for the boundary condition identification problem to be well-posed. As for the {URL} application, the 3-D model was able to completely reproduce the complex measured stress pattern, and the 90° rotation of the principal in situ stresses with depth. In order to reliably estimate the boundary conditions reproducing the current in situ state of stress, response measurements of the rock mass to current disturbances are necessary as input data.},

	abstract = {Subdivision of the Maastrichtian chalk from the Danish North Sea has proven difficult because of its homogenous composition, which is caused by a fairly stable depositional environment; nevertheless, the chalk petrophysical properties show cyclic behavior that potentially can be used for subdivision. Petrophysical properties of a 23 m-long succession of Maastrichtian chalk from the Dan field were examined for cyclicity by spectral analysis. Magnetic susceptibility values measured on plug samples, together with the neutron porosity and natural gamma radiation well-log data, were analyzed both as complete data sets and in subsets to survey the general existence of cycles in the chalk. All three properties contain consistent cycles at approximately 2 m wavelength, as well as additional frequencies where the relative dominance of the different frequencies differs. Cross-spectral analyses of subsets of the petrophysical parameters provide substantial evidence for the coexistence of the approximately 2 m cycles in the Maastrichtian chalk. Furthermore, the magnetic susceptibility carries spectral evidence for a higher frequency because most power spectra of the subsets from the magnetic susceptibility have a spectral peak in the 1.8-2.0 cycles/m interval (i.e., approximately 0.5 m cycle). The cycles can be interpreted as resulting from the eccentricity (94.5 k.y.) and the precession (22.5 k.y.) of the Milankovitch cycles, assuming a sedimentation rate of 2.6 cm/k.y. The existence and the understanding of cycles at a submeter scale yield possibilities for an advantageously precise subdivision of chalk reservoirs and correlation between wells.},

An important component of the model is an incremental stress rheology that accounts for poroelasticity, non-linear viscosity with yield/faulting, pressure solution and fracturing. It couples mechanics to multi-phase flow and diagenesis (through their influence on effective stress and rock rheological properties, respectively). The model is fully {3D} in terms of the full range of fracture orientations and the tensorial nature of stress, deformation and permeability. All rock properties (rheologic, multi-phase fluid transport, grain shape, etc.) are coevolved with the other variables.

These initial deformation bands have an opposite (antithetic) sense of slip with respect to the zone, and are oriented at an acute angle of 55-85° to the trend of the zone. With increasing strain, deformation bands and sedimentary markers become sheared through granular flow across the zone and assume a sigmoidal form. Subsequent bands develop as conjugate shear fractures within the strain-hardened axis of the {PRZ.} These antithetic driven systems are not directly linked to pre-existing or external structural elements and are not compatible with traditional synthetic driven models of Riedel shear zones.},

Information about the research design, intervention and subjects was extracted. Outcome measures and findings were categorised according to {ICF} domains.
Data synthesis
The majority of studies evaluated exercise. Findings were supportive but specific recommendations were limited due to variations in content and application. There was limited quality research to support the theory that manual therapy, electrotherapy or taping in isolation contributes to recovery. Multimodality physiotherapy programmes were found to be beneficial and to reflect clinical practice, but the effectiveness of each component is unknown. Outcome measures from the participation domain of the {ICF} were used least frequently and were not generally true measures of participation.
Conclusion
Development of participation outcome measures is required to evaluate the long-term benefits of interventions. Rehabilitation should be based around delivery of effective exercise programmes incorporating participation outcomes to provide feedback and complement self-care for knee conditions.},

	abstract = {Drag folds (1) from the microfaulting of inclined markers distinguish crenulation cleavage from other cleavage types. Cleavage, as Riedel (R) shears nucleates obliquely to planar anisotropy of foliated rocks and at various angles (related to [alpha]) to the shear zone boundaries. Folds (2) with axes parallel to the instantaneous [lambda]1 at high angle and partway with R-shears are formed in the {XZ} plane of strain ellipsoid. The angle between folds and cleavage is changed in the progressive deformation. The largest antithetic (counterclockwise) R-shears rotation and largest opening of initial angle between folds and fractures up to 170° is achieved in the progressive transtension ([alpha] {\textless} 1). This is not geometrically possible in the simple shear and transpression but forward rotation of the R-shears of excess length is prevented by the constant or diminishing thickness of the shear zone. The crenulation folds (3) amplify the drag folds of the inclined faulted marker and nucleate with axial planes parallel to the cleavage at higher strains. The cleavage propagates further as P-shears, parallel to flanks of tightened crenulation folds. The R-shears are in higher order folds (4) reoriented into the axial planar position by pure shear in the {YZ} plane of the first incremental deformational ellipsoid, and by the shear induced by flexural slip along the layer boundaries. The stretching of the fold limbs and the non coaxial ductile deformation of microlithons in their slip perpendicular to fold axis deform former drag and crenulation folds to a characteristic pattern. Striation and/or faint lineation preserved in the cleavage plane trace the shear directions. The shear sense is indicated by the cleavage-folds transection and by the asymmetrical structures in the plane cut perpendicularly to clevage and parallel to striations.},

	abstract = {Detailed investigation of failure of the borehole wall in two scientific drilling projects, the German {KTB} (Kontinentales Tiefbohrprogramm der Bundesrepublik Deutschland) and the European geothermal research project at Soultz-sous-Forêts, France, has lead to new insight in the phenomena of tensile fractures induced in the wellbore wall during drilling. Comparison of the orientation of the fractures with the orientation of the horizontal principal stress known from breakout and hydraulic fracturing analysis demonstrates that these fractures are reliable indicators of the orientation of the maximum horizontal principal stress {SH.} A model for the initiation of the fractures is presented which points out the important influences of (a) the tectonic stress state, (b) increased mud pressures during drilling operation and (c) thermal stresses induced by circulation of relatively cold drilling mud. Analysis of drilling-induced fractures in the {GPK1} borehole at Soultz-sous-Forêts (where the magnitude of {SH} is known from hydraulic fracturing experiments) demonstrates the validity of this model for the initiation of the fractures. Further, a new method is proposed to estimate the magnitude of {SH} from the occurrence of drilling-induced fractures and knowledge of thermally induced stress and pumping pressure during drilling. The method is successfully applied to both {KTB} boreholes. An independent method to estimate the magnitude of {SH} based on the analytical calculation of the stress intensity factor for drilling-induced fractures taking into consideration both, increased mud pressure and thermal stress, is also presented. Application of this method confirms the results derived with the analysis described above. Additionally, the evaluation of the orientation of the fractures with respect to the wellbore axis indicates that over major depth sections of the investigated wells the vertical stress is a principal stress.},

have shown that scattering effects are more
prominent in models where the crack aperture to
seismic wavelength ratio ranges from 1.3 to 13.3 than
other models where the ratio was varied from 2.3 to
23. The model with large cracks gave a magnitude of
attenuation 3 times higher compared with another
model that had small inclusions. These results
indicate acoustic scattering, attenuation (intrinsic and

shear wave splitting, which in turn is a function of

	abstract = {This paper first reviews the salt basins and depositional ages in the South Atlantic salt province. This comprises a series of salt basins separated by basement highs, deep graben (that never dried up), later volcanic highs and subaerial ocean spreading ridges. Initial halite and anhydrite deposition occurred first in the Sergipe-Alagoas Basin of {NE} Brazil at c. 124.8 Ma, and was closely followed by deposition in the Kwanza Basin, Angola between 124.5 and 121 Ma. The later potassium-magnesium-rich salts were deposited in the Sergipe-Alagoas and Gabon-Congo basins before 114.5 Ma. The age of the main Santos-Campos salt is not known precisely, but the latest anhydrites deposited on the southern margin of the Santos Basin post-date volcanic rocks dated at 113.2 Ma. The paper then compares the salt tectonics of the wide Campos-Santos Basin segment with the narrow South Bahia basins segment. Sediment loading in the Santos Basin produced a landward-dipping base salt, which led to the development of counter-regional faults, and inhibited downslope sliding, and enhanced later contractional effects caused by either gravity spreading or regional tectonic compression. Folding occurred in simultaneous pulses across the Santos Basin, suggesting that regional tectonic compression occurred. The narrow salt basins of South Bahia have a steeply dipping base salt horizon (4\{degrees\}) and pronounced folding, which initiates at the oceanward pinch-out of the salt and propagates back up the slope. The topographic highs, above fold anticlines, are rapidly eroded on narrow margin slopes, which allows the folds to grow more easily to large amplitudes at the top salt horizon.},

Traditional palaeostress regimes (normal, wrench, reverse) represent equal-angular sectors of F' or F, and may be subdivided. On a spherical projection of F against 2y (where y is the bearing of maximum horizontal stress), the locus of all combinations of stress orientation and stress ratio capable of generating one datum (known slip direction on a known fault plane) is a great circle, since {tanF} = - cos(2y - (2s + b))/[Gamma]3 cosb, where tanb = tan[omega]/cosd, and s, d and [omega] are the fault strike, dip and striation pitch, respectively. Stereographic construction is simple using pencil and paper, and gives a visual appreciation of the definition of palaeostress states which could have generated the fault motions. It facilitates better than previous methods (1) the identification of radially symmetrical stress states; (2) recognition of suspect or incompatible data; and (3) delimiting the palaeostress state according to sense of shear, where this is known. Great circle and pole representations are suited to different purposes and data types, for which examples are given.},

We use observations of drilling-induced wellbore failures as well as density, pore pressure, and leak-off test measurements to estimate the magnitudes and orientations of all three principal stresses. Each well yields a very consistent azimuth of the maximum horizontal stress (100°±10°), both with depth and laterally across the field. Stress orientations are constrained at depths as shallow as 2500 m and as deep as 5300 m in these wells. We show that the magnitudes of the three principal stresses (Sv, Shmin, and {SHmax)} are also consistent with depth and reflect a strike-slip to reverse faulting stress regime. The magnitude of the maximum horizontal stress is shown to be significantly higher than the vertical and minimum horizontal stresses (e.g. Sv=55 {MPa}, Shmin=53 {MPa}, and {SHmax=71.5} {MPa} at 2.8 km depth). Data from earthquake focal plane mechanisms (Lindholm et al., 1995, Proceedings of the Workshop on Rock Stresses in the North Sea, Trondheim, Norway [1]) show similar stress orientations and relative magnitudes and thus indicate a stress field that is relatively consistent throughout the thickness of the brittle crust.
We illustrate how knowledge of the full stress tensor allows one to place bounds on in situ rock strength and determine optimally stable trajectories for wellbore stability and sand production during drilling, after the completion of drilling, and as pore pressure is reduced during oil and gas production.},

By extending Bueckner's principle suited for a crack to a general system containing multiple interacting cracks, the original problem is divided into a homogeneous problem (the one without cracks) subjected to remote loads and a multiple crack problem in an unloaded body with applied tractions on the crack surfaces. Thus, the results in terms of the stress intensity factors ({SIFs)} can be obtained by considering the latter problem, which is analyzed easily by means of the displacement discontinuity method with crack-tip elements proposed recently by the author. Test examples are given to illustrate that the numerical approach is very accurate for analyzing interacting multiple cracks in an infinite linear elastic media under remote uniform stresses. In addition, the displacement discontinuity method with crack-tip elements is used to analyze a multiple crack problem in a finite plate. It is found that the boundary element method is also very accurate for investigating interacting multiple cracks in a finite plate. Specially, a generalization of Bueckner's principle and the displacement discontinuity method with crack-tip elements are used to analyze multiple circular arc crack problems in infinite plate in tension (including: Two Collinear Circular Arc Cracks, Three Collinear Circular Arc Cracks, Two Parallel Circular Arc Cracks, Three Parallel Circular Arc Cracks and Two Circular Arc Cracks) in a plane elasticity plate.

There is also very fair agreement for fluid-filled isolated cracks. However, there are considerable differences between two separate theories for fluid-filled cracks with equant porosity. Comparison with recently published experimental data on synthetic sandstones gives a good fit with theory for dry samples. However, although the crack number density in the laboratory sample is such that first-order theory is unlikely to apply, expressions correct to second order (in the number density) provide a worse fit. It also appears that the ratio of wavelength to crack size is not sufficiently great for any detailed comparison with effective-medium theories, which are valid only when this ratio is large. The data show dispersion effects for dry cracks and scattering, neither of which will occur at sufficiently long wavelengths. Data from the water-saturated samples indicate that the effect of equant porosity is significant, although the two theories differ strongly as to just how significant. Once again, and in spite of the reservations mentioned above, a reasonable fit between theory and observation can be shown.},

We used this database to obtain a revised plate-kinematic model. Starting with a new fit-reconstruction for the continents around the South Atlantic, we present a high-resolution isochron map from Chron M4 to present.
Fit reconstructions of South America and Africa that require rigid continental plates result in substantial misfits either in the southern South Atlantic or in the equatorial Atlantic. To achieve a fit without gaps, we assume a combination of complex rift and strike-slip movements:
1. (1) along the South American Parana-Chacos Basin deformation zone,
2. (2) within marginal basins in South America (Salado, Colorado Basin) and
3. (3) along the Benue {Trough/Niger} Rift system in Africa. These faults are presumed to have been active before or during the breakup of the continents.
Our model describes a successive "unzipping" of rift zones starting in the southern South Atlantic. Between 150 Ma (Tithonian) and approximately 130 Ma (Hauterivian), rifting propagated to 38 {°S}, causing tectonic movements within the Colorado and Salado basins. Subsequently, between 130 Ma and Chron M4 (126.5 Ma), the tip of the South Atlantic rift moved to 28 {°S}, resulting in intracontinental deformation along the Parana-Chacos Basin deformation zone. Between Chron M4 and Chron {MO} (118.7 Ma) rifting propagated into the Benue Trough and Niger Rift, inducing rift and strike-slip motion. After Chron {MO}, the equatorial Atlantic began to open, while rifting and strike-slip motion still occurred in the Benue Trough and Niger Rift. Since Chron 34 (84 Ma), the opening of the South Atlantic is characterized by simple divergence of two rigid continental plates.},

Joint deformation can take the form of normal closure, opening, shear and dilation. The resulting changes of aperture can cause as much as three orders of magnitude change in conductivity at moderate compressive stress levels. Even the heavily stressed joints found in oil and gas reservoirs may also exhibit significant stress-dependent conductivity during depletion, and during waterflood treatments. The magnitudes of the above processes are often strongly dependent on both the character and frequency of jointing.
In this paper the results of many years of research on joint properties are synthesized in a coupled joint behaviour model. Methods of joint characterization are described for obtaining the necessary input data. The model simulates stress- and size-dependent coupling of shear stress, diplacement, dilation and conductivity, and of normal stress, closure and conductivity. These processes are the fundamental building blocks of rock mass behaviour. Model simulations are compared with experimental behaviour and numerous examples are given.},

	abstract = {The azimuthally varying non-hyperbolic moveout of P-waves in orthorhombic media can provide valuable information for characterization of fractured reservoirs and seismic processing. Here, we present a technique to invert long-spread, wide-azimuth P-wave data for the orientation of the vertical symmetry planes and five key moveout parameters: the symmetry-plane {NMO} velocities, V(1)nmo and V(2)nmo, and the anellipticity parameters, {03B7(1)}, {03B7(2)} and {03B7(3).} The inversion algorithm is based on a coherence operator that computes the semblance for the full range of offsets and azimuths using a generalized version of the {Alkhalifah2013Tsvankin} non-hyperbolic moveout equation. The moveout equation provides a close approximation to the reflection traveltimes in layered anisotropic media with a uniform orientation of the vertical symmetry planes. Numerical tests on noise-contaminated data for a single orthorhombic layer show that the best-constrained parameters are the azimuth {03C6} of one of the symmetry planes and the velocities V(1)nmo and V(2)nmo, while the resolution in {03B7(1)} and {03B7(2)} is somewhat compromised by the trade-off between the quadratic and quartic moveout terms. The largest uncertainty is observed in the parameter {03B7(3)}, which influences only long-spread moveout in off-symmetry directions. For stratified orthorhombic models with depth-dependent symmetry-plane azimuths, the moveout equation has to be modified by allowing the orientation of the effective {NMO} ellipse to differ from the principal azimuthal direction of the effective quartic moveout term. The algorithm was successfully tested on wide-azimuth P-wave reflections recorded at the Weyburn Field in Canada. Taking azimuthal anisotropy into account increased the semblance values for most long-offset reflection events in the overburden, which indicates that fracturing is not limited to the reservoir level. The inverted symmetry-plane directions are close to the azimuths of the off-trend fracture sets determined from borehole data and shear-wave splitting analysis. The effective moveout parameters estimated by our algorithm provide input for P-wave time imaging and geometrical-spreading correction in layered orthorhombic media.},

	doi = {10.1190/1.2148075},
	abstract = {Mapping seismic data from one acquisition geometry to another is an extremely useful technology. There are several reasonably well known proposed solutions to this problem. These include offerings from Canning and Gardner (Canning and {Gardner,1996),Bleistein} (Bleistein and Jaramillo, 2000), Stolt (Stolt, 2002), Biondi, Fomel, and Chemingue (Biondi et al.,2001; Fomel and {Biondi,1995;Chemingui} and Biondi,1995; Biondi and {Chemingui,1994;Fomel,2003).All} of these articles provide at least one method for mapping input data with arbitrary source-receiver azimuths to data with a fixed source-receiver azimuth. Because it is at least partially based on knowledge of a velocity model for imaging, Bleistein methodology requires the generation of traveltimes and consequently requires a reasonably accurate interval velocity model. Stolt's method circumvents this problem by avoiding the depth domain. The approach developed by Biondi, Fomel, and Chemingue, which I will call integral {AMO} and is based only on normal moveout velocities, offers the potential for an efficient easily parallelized space-time algorithm. In contrast, the method of Canning and Gardner, which I will call F-K {AMO}, is completely velocity {independent.A} primary reason for interest in data mapping exercises is the fact that many modern imaging and coherent noise (e.g. multiple) suppression algorithms demand a specific acquisition geometry. Such requirements range from common-azimuth to full azimuth and full offset geometries. Having a specific geometry allows one to formulate a specific algorithm whose efficiency is dramatically improved by the fact that the data has a specific order or style. Increased efficiency relates directly to increased speed and turnaround and is certainly desirable in a modern fast-paced exploration {setting.In} this article, I investigate the extent to which full azimuth data can be produced from relatively narrow-azimuth data. While I focus on integral and F-K {AMO} the fundamental idea is simple. Instead of trying to generate a full areal shot at each and every location, I generate multiple fixed offset and azimuth volumes. Extracting a fixed receiver ensemble from each of these volumes creates, by source-receiver reciprocity, a full azimuth areal shot. While the implementation of the formulas of integral {AMO} can be more difficult then the approach of Canning and Gardner, the somewhat better amplitude control of integral {AMO} tends to produce a better result. Amplitude control is a critical aspect of data mapping, so it also becomes a key part of the testing and evaluation process. Because of certain potential irregularities in the formulation of integral {AMO}, it is often not easy to achieve.},

	abstract = {Hydrofracturing is a recently developed in-situ stress-measuring method. It consists of hydraulically pressurizing a sealed-off interval inside of a borehole until fracture initiates. The fracture is then extended by additional pumping of fluids from the surface. The pressures recorded during the test can be directly related to the magnitudes of the in-situ principal stresses. The orientation of the fracture in the borehole yields the directions of the principal stresses. The method overcomes some limitations of the more conventional strain-relief techniques: stresses can be determined at any distance from the access point (limited only by hole length), stresses are measured directly, no elastic parameters are required in determining the minimum principal stress, no delicate instruments are used in the borehole, no overcoring is necessary. The hydrofracturing method was theoretically developed for both high- and low-permeability rocks, and was extensively tested in the laboratory under simulated in-situ conditions. These tests confirmed the theoretical assumptions and results. Field measurements were conducted in some ten states within the continental {U.S.}, at depths varying from 100 m (Nevada Test Site) to 1900 m (Rangely, Colorado). The hydrofracturing results were very consistent within each site, and the calculated principal stresses and their directions could, in most cases, be correlated to tectonic phenomena or other measurements and observations. In particular, the stresses determined at Rangely were in accord with the expected condition for the right lateral slip of the existing strike-slip fault, and were used to correctly predict the critical pore pressure necessary to trigger local earthquakes. At the Nevada Test Site, the results of twelve hydrofracturing measurements conducted both from the surface and from underground tunnels indicated a linear increase with depth in all the principal stresses. Hydrofracturing is a simple method of stress determination. It utilizes commercially available packers, pressure lines and pumps, which can be either rented or purchased. It is now being tested in fault zones, in anomalously hot formations, in extremely anisotropic rocks. It is being considered as a major tool in plate-tectonics studies, earthquake control, geothermal-energy extraction from hot dry rock, and new methods of mining.},

Key words used were cryotherapy, return to participation, cold treatment, ice, injury, sport, edema, and pain. {DATA} {SYNTHESIS:} Original research, including outcomes-assessment measures of return to participation of injured subjects, was reviewed using the Physiotherapy Evidence Database ({PEDro)} Scale. Four studies were identified and reviewed by a panel of certified athletic trainers. The 4 articles' scores ranged from 2 to 4 on the {PEDro} scale, which has a maximum of 10 points. Two of the articles suggested that cryotherapy speeds return to participation after ankle sprains. However, these authors failed to provide in-depth statistical analysis of their results. A confounding factor of compression as part of the treatment prevented interpretation of the effects of cryotherapy in 1 article. {CONCLUSIONS:} After critically reviewing the literature for the effect of cryotherapy on return-to-participation measures, we conclude that cryotherapy may have a positive effect. Despite the extensive use of cryotherapy in the management of acute injury, few authors have actually examined the effect of cryotherapy alone on return-to-participation measures. The relatively poor quality of the studies reviewed is of concern. Randomized, controlled clinical studies of the effect of cryotherapy on acute injury and return to participation are needed to better elucidate the treatment responses.},

The case of normal incidence of waves is studied, because we want to remove the influence of the incident angle and to focus purely on the effects of stiffness, spacing and number of parallel fractures.
In the theoretical study, an approach is developed to explicitly take into account the attenuative effect of each fracture with the displacement discontinuity model, and to implicitly consider complex interfracture multiple wave reflections with the method of characteristics. The intrinsic attenuation mechanisms are neglected so that the attenuative effects of the multiple reflections can be concentrated on. This approach does not lose the discreteness of wave attenuation at individual fractures, and avoids the difficulty in explicitly determining the complex process of superposition of multiple reflected and transmitted wave fields. With this approach, a set of recurrence equations with respect to particle velocities before and after the fractures are established. These equations are numerically solved with sufficient accuracy. In analysis, there is no restriction to large fracture spacing or to small fracture spacing compared with wavelength. The magnitude of transmission coefficient ({\textbar}{TN{\textbar})} for waves transmitting normally across a set of multiple parallel fractures is calculated as a function of the ratio ([xi]) of fracture spacing to wavelength, for different normalized stiffness (k/z[omega]) and for a different number of fractures. Parametric studies are conducted to examine the effects of multiple parallel fractures on wave attenuation, especially in terms of the spacing and the number of fractures. It is shown that the dependence of {\textbar}{TN{\textbar}} on the fracture spacing and the fracture number is governed by [xi]. In addition, the effects of multiple wave reflections on {\textbar}{TN{\textbar}} are quantitatively discussed for different values of [xi].
In the numerical modeling, the same problem is studied with a discontinuum-based numerical method, termed as the Discrete Element Method ({DEM).} The Universal Distinct Element Code ({UDEC)} is used to model one-dimensional wave propagation in rock masses containing no fractures, a single planar fracture and multiple parallel planar fractures. The modeling results of the transmission coefficient are compared with the theoretical solutions. An agreement between them has been achieved. It is verified that the {UDEC} is capable of modeling one-dimensional wave propagation across multiple parallel fractures.},

	abstract = {The principles and practice of sequence stratigraphy are of ancient heritage. In North America, the separation of the Carboniferous into two systems and the identification of Ozarkian and Comanchean and other indigenous chronostratigraphic entities were efforts toward making the segmentation of the geologic column more representative of stratigraphic observations, particularly on cratons and their margins. Growing awareness of the influence of tectonics on sedimentation, as well as recognition that unconformity-bounded sedimentary packages identified in Montana were craton-wide, led to this writer's 1948 {GSA} paper which formally applied Native American tribe names to sequences as lithostratigraphic units.
Acceptance of the sequence philosophy beyond the Northwestern campus lacked early manifestations of fervor and enthusiasm, although isolated pockets of true believers were known to exist. Except for papers by me, my students, and the late, lamented H. E. Wheeler, sequences did not appear in the public prints for more than a decade—and then through misappropriation by the {U.S.} Geological Survey. The list of Indian-tribe sequences was emended and completed at another {GSA} presentation in 1959.
Meanwhile the sequence concept was alive and well in a research facility of a company later to be known as Exxon. Here, Peter Vail and a cohort of preconditioned colleagues seized upon the stratigraphic imagery made available by multichannel, digitally recorded, and computer-massaged reflection seismography to establish the discipline of seismic stratigraphy. The {"Vail} curve," recording relative change of coastal onlap, defines successive "sequences" which are the third-order bottom rungs of an elaborate hierarchy that is topped by "megacycle sets," themselves subdivisions of the ancestral sequences.
The taxonomy of sequence stratigraphy is not at issue (although it has been complicated by the sanctification of "synthem" by the International Subcommission on Stratigraphic Classification). Interpretation is important, however; the Exxon people, their alumni, and adherents see sea-level change as the "be-all" and "end-all" of coastal onlap and its erosional and depositional concomitants. No one will question the influence of sea-level change on many of the observations that make sequence stratigraphy viable, but there are distinctions among and within major-scale unconformity-bounded stratal packages that can be explained only by tectonic change. Whether tectonic influence can be extended to Exxonian sequences remains to be demonstrated. Meanwhile, it is worth considering the proposition that sea-level change is a second- or third-order response to some more significant global phenomenon.},

However, experimental data shows that the failure of almost all types of rock masses follows a modified Hoek-Brown ({HB)} failure criterion that is non-linear. In order to avoid the difficulty resulting from the non-linearity of the strength envelope of rock masses in calculation of bearing capacity, the equivalent {MC} strength parameters from the modified {HB} failure criterion are developed for practical use in engineering. From the results, it is found that the equivalent strength parameters depend on not only the non-linear {HB} failure criterion but also the surcharge load and self-weight, which is different from the published results.},

Stress inversion of the fault-slip data was performed using an improved Right-Dihedral method, followed by rotational optimization ({TENSOR} Program, Delvaux, 1993). Fault-slip data (totaling 212) include fault planes, striations and sense of movements, are obtained from the Turonian Wadi As Sir Formation, distributed mainly along the southern side of the Amman - Hallabat structure in Jordan the study area. Results show that [sigma]1 ({SHmax)} and [sigma]3 ({SHmin)} are generally sub-horizontal and [sigma]2 is sub-vertical in 8 of 11 paleostress tensors, which are belonging to a major strike-slip system with [sigma]1 swinging around N to {NW} direction. The other three stress tensors show [sigma]2 ({SHmax)}, [sigma]1 vertical and [sigma]3 is {NE} oriented. This situation explained as permutation of stress axes [sigma]1 and [sigma]2 that occur during tectonic events and partitioned strike slip deformation. {NW} compressional stresses affected the area and produced the major Amman - Hallabat strike-slip fault and its related structures, e.g., {NW} trending normal faults and {NE} trending folds in the study area.

	abstract = {Regional patterns of crustal stresses in Brazil were studied with a detailed breakout analysis performed in 541 wells distributed throughout the country: 481 from basins along the continental margin, and 60 from intracratonic basins. A total of about 591 km of cumulative well length, digitally sampled at 0.15 m intervals, was analysed. Most intervals (80 per cent) are confined between -400 and -4000 m. Only wells that deviate less than 10\&dgrave; from the vertical were considered. For a given well (1) the mean orientation and the standard deviation of each interval with breakouts were calculated, (2) all intervals with mean breakout orientations less than 10\&dgrave; from the orientation of the hole deviation were discarded, (3) all intervals with standard deviations less than 12\&dgrave; were selected, (4) the selected breakouts were weighted by their interval length to calculate the mean orientation and standard deviation of the whole well, and (5) the final results were classified according to the World Stress Map criteria. Thus, 16 wells were classified as A (a total of 7.2 km of breakouts), 42 as B (7.1 km), 78 as C (7.4 km), 205 as D (3.3 km), 184 as E (0.7 km) and 16 were discarded. In most basins, the breakout orientations from different wells were usually consistent for qualities A, B and C, allowing a good estimate of the regional maximum horizontal stress ({SHmax);} wells classified as quality D showed a large scatter. The regional {SHmax} determined from breakouts is generally in good agreement with the available nearby focal mechanisms. The main trends of {SHmax} are (1) {NW-SE}, parallel to the coast, along the equatorial marginal basins, (2) E-W in the Alagoas Basin, (3) {NNE-SSW}, parallel to the coast, in the Sergipe and Reconcavo basins, and (4) {NW-SE} in the Middle Amazon Basin. In the equatorial and eastern continental margins, north of {15\&dgrave;S}, breakouts and focal mechanism measurements indicate that the {SHmax} orientation is remarkably parallel to the coastline, following a 90\&dgrave; bend of the coast in northeastern Brazil. Because the theoretically predicted intraplate stresses in northern Brazil trend about {WNW} to {ENE} (e.g. Meijer 1995; Coblentz \& Richardson 1996), we interpret our observations as indicating that local sources of stress at the continental margins (e.g. flexural stresses and lateral density contrasts) dominate the plate-wide stresses and may have been underestimated in theoretical stress models of the South American plate. The new stress data (136 A-C quality out of a population of 541 wells) cover a region of mid-plate South America where only 23 data points had been compiled previously in the World Stress Map database. The more detailed observed patterns of the intraplate stress field should be helpful in better constraining future models of the forces driving the South American plate.},

Subjects Seventy-four subjects with {ACL} reconstruction participated in the study.
Methods The study was a randomized, single-blinded, controlled trial. The {NT} and {ST} groups were tested preoperatively and at 3 and 6 months. The main outcome measure was the Cincinnati Knee Score. Secondary outcome measures were visual analog scales ({VASs)} for pain and function, the 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey ({SF-36)}, hop tests, isokinetic muscle strength, proprioception, and static and dynamic balance tests.
Results The {NT} group demonstrated significantly improved Cincinnati Knee Scores and {VAS} scores for global knee function compared with the {ST} group at the 6-month follow-up. There were no significant differences between the groups for the other outcome measures (ie, hop, balance, proprioception, and muscle strength tests).
Discussion and Conclusion The results of this study suggest that exercises included in the {NT} program should be part of the rehabilitation program following {ACL} reconstruction.},

These results indicate the great importance of crack geometry to the behaviour of precursors. The velocities of saturated cracks appear to favour the dilatancy-diffusion model of precursory phenomena. Synthetic seismograms are calculated for propagation through possible dilatancy zones. The seismograms show some characteristic features which may be useful for the investigation of earthquake dilatancy.},

The deformation is accomplished by initially generating an array of oblique, mainly tensile, cracks at the tip of the slot, which are subsequently linked to form a rupture zone. This suggests a more general model for the formation of brittle shear rupture. A through-going shear surface will form if a damage zone is concentrated enough in the appropriate orientation. This may occur at the edges of an existing shear strain discontinuity, such as a fault, particularly in a mode 3 displacement field. Thus under some conditions faults may grow or link up as true macroscopic shear ruptures. This may be part of a solution to the apparent paradox of the existence of long faults. We suggest features that would indicate this sequence of formation in the field and review some geological examples.},

	abstract = {Theoretical reconstruction of the stress fields in tectonic plates or particular tectonic regions is an important geophysical problem. Conventional approaches for solving this vital issue are based on classical formulations of boundary value problems of elasticity. In these approaches, stress fields are calculated for diverse boundary conditions defined on the margins of the region in order to fit the experimentally observed orientations of principal stresses inside the region.
The present article identifies the major flaw in the conventional approach, which is the impossibility of obtaining a unique and reliable stress field, and suggests alternative methods based on the analysis of orientations of principal stresses. Three methods for determining the elastic state of stress in relatively stable blocks of the lithosphere are described and applied to particular tectonic domains. All of the methods are based on the direct use of experimental data on the stress orientations as input information. The first method exploits direct integration of the equations of elasticity when the field of principal stress trajectories is prescribed within a region. The second one utilizes the non-classical boundary value problem of elasticity, which uses experimentally obtained stress orientations at the region margins as boundary conditions. The third method is aimed at the numerical determination of the stress field from a given set of spatially discrete principal stress orientations.
In contrast to the conventional approach, the methods suggested here do not require knowledge of the boundary stress magnitudes. As a consequence, the general solution of the problem becomes non-unique. However, in the case of an elastic medium, only a certain (finite) number of arbitrary parameters control the general solutions. These parameters can be determined from in situ stress measurements within the region under study. Therefore, for the selected spatial scale, the unique stress field can be singled out. In the second method, the number of parameters (and, thus, the minimum number of field measurements) is determined from an analysis of boundary stress orientations alone. In other methods, this number depends upon the harmonicity or non-harmonicity of inclination of the prescribed stress trajectories (for the second method) and the calculated stress trajectories (for the third method).
To illustrate the essence of the proposed methods, they are applied to the determination of first-order stress fields in the West European and Australian platforms. These platforms represent two basically different types of stress domains. The stress field for the West European platform reflects nearly homogeneous stress orientations throughout the extent of the region, whereas the Australian platform is characterized by rotation of the principal stress axes while traversing the region margins. In the case of Australia, an important result is the existence (at the chosen spatial scale) of a singular point inside the Australian continent at which the curvature of the stress trajectories is infinite. The local state of stress near such a point has important geophysical and engineering implications.
The proposed approaches can be applied not only for the determination of regional stress fields but also at other spatial scales, depending on the scale at which the stress indicators have been characterized.},

We present a method to integrate observed fracture data into a three-dimensional structural model to generate realistic predictive fracture networks. We use a new technique for acquiring fracture data from analog outcrops using a long-range three-dimensional laser scanning system. Sub-planar regions within the laser scan data are identified using automated and semi-automated feature extraction algorithms. Descriptive population and clustering statistics are automatically computed from the geometry of detected fractures. These fracture statistics are used to stochastically populate a three-dimensional volume with synthetic fractures. The three-dimensional synthetic fracture network may be analyzed topologically to define fracture connectivity and used as a resource for well planning or upscaling for simulation, thus providing an important link between field data and synthetic discrete fracture networks. These new techniques have been applied to blasted outcrop faces in southern Arizona to evaluate fracture systems and population statistics. The fracture attributes were used to generate a simulated, three-dimensional fractured reservoir model with a synthetic fracture network.},

	abstract = {Although the Iberia-Newfoundland and Alpine Tethys margins are of different age and ultimately had a different fate, they share remarkable similarities. Both pairs of margins show a change from initially distributed and decoupled extension to later localized, coupled and asymmetric extension that results in thinning of the crust and exhumation of subcontinental mantle. The change in the mode of extension together with the localization of deformation reflects an evolution of the bulk rheology of the extending lithosphere. In this paper we summarize the pertinent geological observations for the Iberia-Newfoundland and Alpine Tethys margins. We describe the stratigraphic evolution, the fault geometry, basin architecture, and magmatic and metamophic evolution of the two pairs of margins from initial rifting to final continental breakup. This description forms a basis for understanding the evolution of the bulk rheology and how the various processes interact during progressive lithospheric extension. For the Iberia-Newfoundland and Alpine Tethys margins initial rifting appears to be controlled by inherited heterogeneities and mechanical localization processes, whereas final rifting and lithospheric rupture is controlled by serpentinization, magmatic and thermal weakening. At other margins, these modes may interact in a different way depending on the prerift conditions and the evolution of the rheology during rifting.},

	abstract = {A wide variety of numerical procedures in potential field geophysics require data modelled on a regular grid. However, airborne data tend to be highly sampled along the flight line and sparsely sampled in the perpendicular direction. A gridding method commonly called 'bi-cubic spline' is widely used in potential field geophysics. Standard bi-cubic spline methods used on aeromagnetic data produce artefacts when a geological feature's 'line of strike' is not perpendicular to the direction of the acquisition line. This method has a tendency to break up thin elongated magnetic anomalies, at an oblique angle, into a series of bulls eye artefacts. A method of finding local anomalies and their strike along lines based upon minimum variance principles reduces these effects. This technique has significant impact on the quality of output grids. In association with the Magnetic Image Project ({MAGMAGE)} developed by Gunn and collaborators, that involved work on complex attributes of aeromagnetic anomalies, the gridding of phase posed some unique problems. Raw phase is a spiralling function which is periodic and cyclic. Unwrapping of the phase, therefore, is necessary to give a spatially coherent grid for interpretation. By focussing on two developments in gridding ? trending in a bi-cubic spline method and unwrapping of cyclic data ? these methods are shown to increase the accuracy of representation of actual data being interpolated. Case studies of these solutions are presented using the {INTREPID} geophysical processing and visualisation system.},

	abstract = {There has been a great deal of interest in mapping regional trends in stress orientation and their relationships to crustal deformation processes over the last quarter century. Less emphasis has been placed on explaining local variations in the stress field. However, it is variations in the local stress field which are most critical to characterizing hydrocarbon reservoirs. Fracture orientation, well stability, well orientation, and permeability anisotropy are all strongly affected by variations in the local stress field. Using stress orientation data from a number of fields in different tectonic environments, we have tried to determine some of the tectonic and geological controls on variations in in situ stress orientation. We find that nearness to faults, fault structure, and magnitude of tectonic stress play primary roles in determining whether the regional stress field will be perturbed in a given reservoir and whether small-scale variations in the stress field can be expected. We find that high tectonic stress environments (large horizontal differential stress) lead to a much more consistent local stress field than more tectonically quiescent areas. Faults can play a large role in rotating the local stress field. The smaller the difference between the maximum and minimum horizontal stress magnitude (i.e. lower tectonic stress), the larger a fault's zone of influence is. Large-scale faulting with segmentation of the reservoir into discrete fault blocks can lead to significant stress orientation variations across the reservoir even in areas of large differential stress.},

	abstract = {The present-day state of stress in Tertiary deltas is poorly understood but vital for a range of applications such as wellbore stability and fracture stimulation. The Tertiary Baram Delta province, Brunei, exhibits a range of contemporary stress values that reflect the competing influence of the northwest Borneo active margin (situated underneath the basin) and local stresses generated within the delta. Vertical stress (\{sigma\}v) gradients at 1500-m (4921-ft) depth range from 18.3 {MPa/km} (0.81 psi/ft) at the shelf edge to 24.3 {MPa/km} (1.07 psi/ft) in the hinterland, indicating a range in the shallow bulk density across the delta of 2.07-2.48 g/cm3. The maximum horizontal stress (\{sigma\}Hmax) orientation rotates from margin parallel (northeast-southwest; deltaic) in the outer shelf to margin normal (northwest-southeast; basement associated) in the inner shelf. Minimum horizontal stress (\{sigma\}hmin) gradients in normally pressured sequences range from 13.8 to 17.0 {MPa/km} (0.61-0.75 psi/ft) with higher gradients observed in older parts of the basin. The variation in contemporary stress across the basin reveals a delta system that is inverting and self-cannibalizing as the delta system rapidly progrades across the margin. The present-day stress in the delta system has implications for a range of exploration and production issues affecting Brunei. Underbalanced wells are more stable if deviated toward the \{sigma\}hmin direction, whereas fracture stimulation in mature fields and tight reservoirs can be more easily conducted in wells deviated toward \{sigma\}Hmax. Finally, faults near the shelf edge are optimally oriented for reactivation, and hence exploration targets in this region are at a high risk of fault seal breach.},

The experiments were performed on a physical model consisting of two sets of fractures. The first set consisted of orientated rubber inclusions simulating weak material-filled cracks. The second set consisted of a system of closely spaced parallel fractures simulated by thin plates of epoxy resin, superimposed orthogonally on the first set. Three cases of fracture orientations within the model were identified and studied. Case 1 is analogous to a jointed fracture reservoir with one vertical set of fluid-filled cracks or fractures and one non-filled horizontal set. This case is referred to as {JFV.} Case 2 is analogous to a double fracture reservoir with one horizontal set of fluid-filled fractures or cracks and one non-filled vertical set. This is referred to as {DFH.} Case 3 is analogous to a double fracture reservoir with two vertical sets of fractures or cracks, with only one fluid-filled. Case 3 is referred to as {DFV.} A pulse transmission method was performed on all three modelled cases along the three principal axes. A directional variation in the compressional- and shear-wave velocities, as well as distinct shear-wave splitting, was observed. The elastic constants for each case were determined and differences between them were noted and compared with the controlled results of both layered (transverse isotropy, {TI)} and vertically fractured (azimuthally anisotropic models, {VF)} media. The differences in elastic moduli and velocities indicate the potential of recognizing the different fracture orientations and suggest an approach to designing a method of drilling to further enhance oil recovery and reservoir exploitation.},

About half of the sites are fully explored or even developed and producing fields, and hard quantitative data on the reservoirs are available (well data, reservoir monitoring data, seismic surveys, etc.). The other areas are essentially either explored prospect areas where we did not have access to hard reservoir data or (in only one case) areas where no exploration wells have been drilled at all. The tremor signal itself was observed over {ALL} locations investigated so far. The signals weaken at the rim of the reservoirs and are not observed outside the reservoir area. There is a strong correlation of the tremor power with the thickness of the hydrocarbon-bearing layers ([`]pay zone thickness') determined by borehole log measurements. The overall correlation between surface tremor measurements and accessible subsurface well data is higher than 90\%. The phenomenological comparison of hydrocarbon tremor signals with volcanic tremor signals from Stromboli and Arenal volcanoes using both conventional spectral analysis tools and non-linear dynamics methods reveals fundamental similarities between those two phenomena as well as their close relation to bandpass filtered noise. Nevertheless, the specific signal sources are expected to be different for volcanoes and hydrocarbon reservoirs. Using the currently available data we present possible concepts (active or passive mechanisms) on the nature of the hydrocarbon tremor source. Our data lead us to conclude that we are most likely observing a characteristic filtering/mixing effect, with the energy input supplied by the natural seismo-acoustic background. The reservoir, i.e. the hydrocarbon-water-multifluid system contained in a porous medium, is expected to be the oscillatory element able to act as a filter/mixer (resembling essentially a in-reservoir path effect) for the natural seismo-acoustic background. Most intriguing seems the application aspect, i.e. the practical usability of this spectroscopic approach as a direct from-the-surface, non-invasive hydrocarbon indicator.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}

Nutrition scientists are showing growing interest in the diet patterns of preagricultural (hunter-gatherer) humans. Retrojected preagricultural diets are reportedly predominantly net base producing in contrast to the net acid-producing modern Western diets.


{OBJECTIVE}

We examined the dietary net acid load [net endogenous acid production ({NEAP)]} for 229 worldwide historically studied hunter-gatherer societies to determine how differences in plant-to-animal ({P:A)} dietary subsistence patterns and differences in the percentage of body fat in prey animals affect the {NEAP.}


{DESIGN}

With the use of 1) ethnographic data of dietary {P:A} ratios of hunter-gatherer populations, 2) established computational methods, and 3) knowledge that fat densities of animal foods consumed by hunter-gatherers varied between 3\% and 20\%, we computed the {NEAP} for the diets of 229 populations in 4 different models of animal fat densities (model A, 3\%; model B, 10\%; model C, 15\%; model D, 20\%).


{RESULTS}

As {P:A} ratios decreased from 85:15 to 5:95, the {NEAP} increased from -178 to +181 {mEq/d} (model A) and from -185 to +120 {mEq/d} (models B and C). Approximately 50\% of the diets consumed by the 229 worldwide hunter-gatherer populations were net acid producing (models B and C). In model D, 40\% of the diets were net acid producing.


{CONCLUSIONS}

Our data confirm that the {NEAP} of hunter-gatherer diets becomes progressively more positive as {P:A} ratios decline. The high reliance on animal-based foods of a worldwide sample of historically studied hunter-gatherer populations renders their diets net acid producing in approximately 40-60\% of subgroups of {P:A} ratios. Only further investigations can show the implications of these findings in determining the {NEAP} of human ancestral diets.},

	abstract = {A simple model which describes the failure of brittle rock under cyclic compressive loading is presented. It is assumed that the damage incurred by the material during each stress cycle is due to the extension of tensile microcracks and that the specimen will fail when the microcrack damage reaches a critical level. Two mechanisms for crack extension, stress corrosion and cyclic fatigue are assumed to act simultaneously and independently. The rate of crack growth due to stress corrosion was determined from an empirical relationship for the static fatigue of glass. The equation describing the rate of crack growth due to cyclic fatigue was taken to be similar to those derived for structural metals. By combining the crack extension rates due to these two processes, the time to failure for a specimen subjected to a given cyclic loading program was computed. The time to failure was found to depend strongly on the mean differential stress and the magnitude of the stress change during each cycle. At high mean stress and low cycle amplitude, stress corrosion dominates, whereas at low mean stress and high cycle amplitude, cyclic fatigue dominates. The predictions of the model are in good agreement with existing experimental data. Further, the model explains the observed breakdown of discrete memory in dilatant rock under certain stress conditions.},

Interval velocities measured from shear waves polarized parallel to fracture trends ({SH} to north and {SV} to west) are 5\% to 10\% higher than shear waves polarized orthogonal to fractures. Also, P-wave interval velocities to the north appear to be 2\% to 5\% higher than to the west. These results are consistent with nonvertical oriented fractures. Reflection images of these offset {VSPs} show that the west {SH} {VSP} has an increasing delay with depth of 10 ms per 1000 ft compared to the north {SH} {VSP.} P-wave reflection images show a similar relationship of several ms per 1000 ft.

Conventional wisdom assumes that fluids prefer to flow along fractures oriented parallel or nearly parallel to modern-day maximum horizontal compressive stress, or {SHmax.} The reasoning is that these fractures have the lowest normal stresses across them and therefore provide the least resistance to flow. For example, this view governs how geophysicists design and interpret seismic experiments to probe fracture fluid pathways in the deep subsurface. Contrary to these widely held views, here we use core, stress measurement, and fluid flow data to show that {SHmax} does not necessarily coincide with the direction of open natural fractures in the subsurface ({\textgreater}3 km depth). Consequently, in situ stress direction cannot be considered to predict or control the direction of maximum permeability in rock. Where effective stress is compressive and fractures are expected to be closed, chemical alteration dictates location of open conduits, either preserving or destroying fracture flow pathways no matter their orientation.},

	abstract = {The wall rocks of a crustal scale sinistral ductile shear zone in Namibia, the Purros Mylonite Zone, contain two types of asymmetric quartz veins. Bedding surfaces contain sigmoidal quartz veins with limited thickness along their symmetry axes that can be classified as tension gashes. A second type of veins consists of a striated central fault vein separating pennant-type quartz filled terminations. The tips of these "pennant veins" have a different orientation to those of the tension gashes. Analogue experiments were carried out using a sheet of silicone powder suspended on a slab of poly-dimethyl-siloxane ({PDMS)}, both deformed in simple shear. These experiments produced open fractures very similar to the pennant veins that form by intersection of R and R' Riedel shear fractures. These fractures rotate and slip during progressive deformation, opening pennant shaped gaps. We interpret the natural pennant veins to form by the same mechanism of R and R' shear fracture initiation, and subsequent rotation and opening. Since this mechanism differs from that of previously described vein types such as wing cracks, tension gashes and swordtail or fishmouth termination veins, which mainly open as tension veins, we consider pennant veins as in new independent class of asymmetric mineral-filled veins.},

	abstract = {An extensive data-set of petrophysical down-hole measurements exists for boreholes drilled into continental crystalline crust. We selected boreholes covering a range of different types of plutonic rocks and gneisses in amphibolite or high-grade metamorphic rocks. According to Serra’s concept of electrofacies, a specific set of log responses should characterize one rock type. Here, we concentrate on the detection of compositional variations between rock types. Bulk composition of the protoliths influences the mineralogical composition of the metamorphic rock, and we demonstrate how this impacts on the down-hole measurements. Integration of logging data with geochemical core data and mineralogical descriptions allows the calibration of the log responses to rock types. The relationship of the log responses with core data shows a remarkably good correlation, and diagnostic trends are detected. From the logs, potassium and neutron porosity are particularly helpful in distinguishing different types of gneisses and igneous rocks with respect to their protoliths. The proportions of amphibole/pyroxene, mica + K-feldspar and feldspar + quartz in the rocks seem to control the direction of correlation in a cross-plot, i.e. positive or negative, depending on increasing or decreasing mineral proportions. This is true for all boreholes, and a generalized classification scheme could be developed for these crystalline rocks.},

	doi = {10.1016/0148-9062(92)93656-5},
	abstract = {The mechanical and hydraulic properties of many rock masses are affected significantly by the additional mechanical compliance and fluid conductivity that result from joints, fractures or faults. The effects of these features, generally referred to as joints, can be so pronounced in many problems in geology or geophysics, mining or petroleum engineering, hydrogeology and waste management that it is important to be able to locate and characterize them remotely within a rock mass using geophysical methods. The effect of joints on seismic wave propagation, therefore, becomes important also. Experimental measurements of the deformation of natural joints are analyzed in terms of theories concerning the roughness of the two joint surfaces and their deformation under stress. For many rocks, the deformation of the surfaces is reversible after the first few cycles of loading and unloading and is, therefore, elastic. The highly non-linear stress-deformation curves for joints must be a result of changes in the geometry of the areas of contact between asperities brought about by the elastic deformation of adjacent voids in response to changes in the applied stress.
The flow of fluids between the surfaces of a joint must also depend upon the geometry of the void space between these surfaces. Measurements using liquid metal porosimetry, show that when the two surfaces of a natural joint are in contact with one another, this geometry becomes so complex that fluid through the joint cannot be approximated as laminar flow between parallel surfaces leading to a cubic relation between flux and aperture. At low stresses, fluid flow through a joint decreases much faster than the cube of the joint closure. This is shown to be a result of changes in contact area, tortuosity and hydraulic aperture brought about by deformation of the void space between the two surfaces of the joint. At high stresses, fluid flow through a joint asymptotes to an irreducible level, largely independent of joint closure and further changes in stress.
The slope of a tangent to the curve relating the average closure between the two surfaces of a joint to the stress across the joint defines a specific stiffness for the joint at that stress. The effect of joints on seismic waves can be analyzed by using this specific stiffness as a boundary condition in the seismic wave equation. Displacements across this boundary are discontinuous while stresses are continuous. Although the specific stiffness of the joint and the properties of the rock on each side of it are assumed to be completely elastic, the displacement discontinuity leads to frequently-dependent reflection and transmission coefficients for compressional and shear waves as well as frequency-dependent group time delay for the transmitted waves. This concept can be extended to include a velocity discontinuity across the joint, where the contained fluid or the properties of the rock provide viscous as well as elastic coupling across a joint. Theoretical predictions based on the displacement discontinuity and velocity discontinuity theories agree very well with the results of laboratory measurements of seismic pulses transmitted across natural joints with different specific stiffnesses.},

This paper presents some techniques used at {ENI-Agip} for fracture network simulation at wellbore scale. First, new imaging techniques adopted for enhancing and facilitating the data acquisition from orientated cores will be shown. We will discuss how the fracture data, acquired from the combined analysis of orientated core and wellbore image logs, have to be processed in order to calculate the geometrical parameters of each feature (dip direction, dip, size, terminations) and to classify them according to their filling (oil, water, shale, calcite, etc.). Second, we will illustrate how these kind of data are processed in order to extract the fracture representative parameters needed for stochastic simulation of fracture network at the wellbore scale: spatial distribution along the cored/logged interval, number of fracture sets, representative orientation and statistical distribution of each set, distribution laws of the fracture length and relevant minimum radii and fracture aperture estimate. Fracture porosity evaluation, matrix block size, fracture network connectivity at wellbore scale constitute the outputs of such simulations: they are used to better characterize a fractured reservoir and to describe its behaviour. The synthetic results of the application of such a methodology on a real case (tight packstone/wackestone of carbonate platform from a southern Apennine italian oil reservoir) complete the paper.},

	abstract = {Integrated structural analyses of seismic and various well data are necessary to optimize hydrocarbon reservoir characterization. However, there are many published examples from the oil and gas industry where single data types are analysed but not integrated. This may lead to erroneous interpretations and drainage strategies. As illustrated by an example from the area around well 34/10-B-12 in the North Sea Gullfaks Field, integrated structural interpretation should typically utilize all available seismic surveys, well log correlation data, dipmeter data and core data. Interpretation of seismic data helps in the understanding of large-scale structural and stratigraphic geometries. Time-lapse ({4D)} seismic helps to identify changes in reservoir properties caused by injection and production. Well log correlation data are used to document variations in zonation thickness caused by sedimentological or structural changes. Dipmeter data tie observations of bedding orientation from seismic data to subseismic scale. Core data represent the most detailed (millimetre to metre scale) data available and can yield information on rock properties as well as sedimentological and (micro)structural features. Small-scale deformation structures such as deformation bands and fractures can typically be identified and characterized. In addition, it is possible from unorientated cores to find the orientation of bedding and deformation structures. This information is compared to observations from dipmeter data, well log correlation data and seismic data to improve the interpretation. Well 34/10-B-12 is a hanging wall injector near one of the large-scale faults in the Gullfaks Field. Several {3D} seismic surveys are available from the area, as are standard well log data, dipmeter information and cores. Together, the data range from millimetre to kilometre with some overlap between the data types. Through integrated analysis, pitfalls such as interpreting any linear feature on timedip attribute maps as faults has been avoided. Also, a geometric relation between core-scale and seismic-scale faults has been established, and it has been possible to relate small-scale and large-scale structures in a model which is consistent with all the available data.},

A shear wave propagating in an azimuthally anisotropic medium splits into two components with different polarizations if the source polarization is not aligned with the principal axes of the medium. For vertical propagation of shear waves in a horizontally layered medium containing vertical fractures, the shear-wave splitting depends on the shear compliance of the fractures, but is independent of their normal compliance. If the fractures are not perfectly vertical, the shear-wave splitting also depends on the normal compliance of the fractures. The normal compliance of a fluid-filled fracture decreases with increasing fluid bulk modulus. For dipping fractures, this results in a decrease in shear-wave splitting and an increase in shear-wave velocity with increasing fluid bulk modulus. The sensitivity of the shear-wave splitting to fluid bulk modulus depends on the interconnectivity of the fracture network, the permeability of the background medium and on whether the fracture is fully or partially saturated.},

	abstract = {Natural fractures in reservoirs play an important role in determining fluid flow during production, and hence the density and orientation of fractures is of great interest. In the presence of aligned vertical fractures, the reflection amplitude at finite offset varies with azimuth. The effect of natural fractures on the azimuthal {AVO} response from a gas-sandstone reservoir encased within shale is investigated. A simple expression for the difference in P-wave reflection coefficient from the top of the reservoir parallel and perpendicular to the strike of the fractures is obtained in terms of the normal and tangential compliances, {ZN} and {ZT}, of the fractures. This expression is valid for small anisotropy and material contrasts and is compared with the results of numerical modelling. For a given value of {ZT}, the azimuthal variation in reflection coefficient at moderate offsets is found to increase with decreasing {ZN/ZT.} For gas-filled open fractures {ZN/ZT} ≈ 1, but a lower ratio of {ZN/ZT} may result from the presence of cement or clay within the fractures, or from the presence of a fluid with non-zero bulk modulus. For {ZN/ZT} = 1 and moderate offsets, the variation with offset of the reflection coefficient from the top of the fractured unit is dominated by the contrast in Poisson's ratio between the gas sand and the overlying shale, the effect of fractures only becoming noticeable as the critical angle for the unfractured sandstone is approached. However, for reflections from the base of the fractured unit, the variation in reflection amplitude with azimuth is much greater at conventional seismic offsets than for the reflection from the top. Azimuthal variations in the strength of the reflection from the top of the reservoir depend only on the variation in reflection coefficient, whereas the raypath is also a function of azimuth for reflections from the base of the fractured unit, leading to stronger, more visible, variations of {AVO} with azimuth. It follows that an azimuthal variation in {AVO} due to fractures in the overburden may be misinterpreted as due to the presence of aligned fractures in the reservoir.},

	abstract = {We propose an approach for estimating the permeability tensor using seismic emission induced by borehole hydraulic tests or by a fluid injection of an arbitrary nature. This approach provides a single estimation of the permeability tensor for the complete heterogeneous rock volume where the seismic emission was recorded. The approach is an extension of the method proposed by Shapiro et al. (1997) for the isotropic case. It is based on the hypothesis that the triggering front of the hydraulic-induced microseismicity propagates like a low-frequency second-type compressional Biot wave (corresponding to the process of pore-pressure relaxation) in an effective homogeneous anisotropic poroelastic fluid-saturated medium. The permeability tensor of this effective medium is the permeability tensor of the heterogeneous rock volume upscaled to the characteristic size of the seismically active region. We demonstrate the method using the microseismic data collected during the Hot Dry Rock Soultz-sous-For�ts experiment (Dyer et al. 1994). These data show that the corresponding rock volume is characterized by a significant permeability anisotropy caused by oriented crack systems. The maximal principal component of the permeability tensor has a subvertical orientation. It is about seven times larger than the minimal subhorizontal principal component.},

We further illustrate how such information allows one to place bounds on in-situ effective rock strength. We consider a deviated well in the Visund oil field on the flanks of the Viking Graben along the Norwegian margin. A good quality electrical imaging log revealed drilling-induced tensile wall fractures in an orientation consistent with other observations of stress orientation in the region. Interpretation of these fractures indicates that the maximum horizontal stress is 72±6.5 {MPa} at an azimuth of 100°±10°. No breakouts were detectable in the well, indicating that the uniaxial compressive rock strength is greater than approximately 19 {MPa.} We demonstrate how we utilized this information to design an optimally-stable wellbore trajectory to minimize sand production.},

Moreover, sealed fractures parallel to Snma? are numerous. Parallelism of {SHm?} and open fractures is not good evidence, by itself, that modem-day stress controls the orientation of open fractures. A determining factor for fluid flow is the degree of mineral cement within fractures, which is a function of fracture size and the rock's diagenetic history. In most subsurface opening-mode fracture systems, fractures are partly filled with cement deposited at the time of fracturing. This cement forms strong mineral bridges that prop the fracture open. The remaining part of the fracture may be open or filled with cements precipitated after fractures ceased opening. For the many reservoirs in which opening-mode fractures are the key flow pathways, cement patterns rather than stress data may provide the insight needed to determine which fractures are open to fluid flow.},

	abstract = {The World Stress Map ({WSM)} project is a global compilation of information on the contemporary crustal stress field from a wide range of stress indicators. The {WSM} database release 2008 contains 21,750 stress data records that are quality-ranked using an updated and refined quality-ranking scheme. Almost 17,000 of these data records have A-C quality and are considered to record the orientation of maximum horizontal compressional stress {SH} to within ±25°. As this is almost a triplication of data records compared with the first {WSM} database release in 1992, we reinvestigate the spatial wave-length of the stress patterns with a statistical analysis on a global 0.5° grid. The resulting smoothed global stress map displays both; the mean {SH} orientation that follows from the maximum smoothing radius for which the standard deviation is {\textless}25° and a countour map that displays the wave-length of the stress pattern. This smoothed global map confirms that long wave-length stress patterns ({\textgreater}2000 km) exist for example in North America and {NE} Asia. These have been used in earlier analyses to conclude that the global stress pattern is primarily controlled by plate boundary forces that are transmitted into the intraplate region. However, our analysis reveals that rather short wave-length of the stress pattern {\textless}200 km are quite frequent too, particularly in western Europe, Alaska and the Aleutians, the southern Rocky Mountains, Basin and Range province, Scandinavia, Caucasus, most of the Himalayas and Indonesia. This implies that local stress sources such as density contrasts and active fault systems in some areas have high impact in comparison to plate boundary forces and control the regional stress pattern.},

	abstract = {Elastic stiffness tensor values in cracked rocks depend on the crack density, and on the shapes, fluid content, orientation, and spatial distribution of the cracks. The mathematical expression of anisotropy is embedded in the elastic stiffness tensor. Thus, in reservoir characterization by anisotropic seismic modeling, inversion and interpretation, a key step is to represent the rock properties in terms of the equivalent anisotropic elastic stiffness tensor. We compare the strengths, limitations, and relationships between the anisotropic elastic stiffness tensor elements predicted for a transversely isotropic medium with a horizontal symmetry axis, using a variety of theoretical formulations, including equivalent single inclusion approximations, smoothing, self consistent approximation ({SCA)}, differential effective medium ({DEM)} methods, linear slip ({LS)}, and T-matrix methods. These formulations differ in their crack parametrizations, the assumptions and approximations involved, and the corresponding consequences of these. All the formulations involve theoretical extrapolations. Absolute accuracy is not known for high crack density because, while there is substantial internal consistency between the theoretical results when crack interactions are included, there is to date, only limited external validation in terms of physical and numerical experiments at high crack densities. At high crack densities, where crack interactions are important, physically reasonable values are expected to be predicted only by the formulations that implicitly or explicitly consider these effects. These methods are the {SCA}, {DEM}, {LS} and T-matrix methods. For a coal example, all these four methods predict similar elastic stiffness tensor values up to volume crack densities of ≤ 0.3, beyond which, the spatial distribution of cracks in the various models becomes increasingly important. In a medium with perfectly aligned fractures, the shear modulus normal to the symmetry plane shows the greatest relative variation between models at high crack density. © 2010 Geophysical Press Ltd.},

	abstract = {The Iberia Abyssal Plain segment of the West Iberia margin was drilled during Ocean Drilling Program Legs 149 and 173 and has been extensively studied geophysically. We present new microstructural investigations and new age data. These, together with observed distribution of upper- and lower-crustal and mantle rocks along the ocean-continent transition suggest the existence of three detachment faults, one of which was previously unrecognized. This information, together with a simple kinematic inversion of the reinterpreted seismic section Lusigal 12, allows discussion of the kinematic evolution of detachment faulting in terms of the temporal sequence of faulting, offset along individual faults, and thinning of the crust during faulting. Our study shows that the detachment structures recognized in the seismic profile became active only during a final stage of rifting when the crust was already considerably thinned to c. 12 km. The total amount of extension accommodated by the detachment faults is of the order of 32.6 km corresponding to a \{beta\} factor of about two. During rifting, the mode of deformation changed oceanwards. Initial listric faulting led to asymmetric basins, accommodating low amounts of extension, and was followed by a situation in which the footwall was pulled out from underneath a relatively stable hanging wall accommodating high amounts of extension. Deformation along the latter faults resulted in a conveyor-belt type sediment accumulation in which the exhumed footwall rocks were exposed, eroded and redeposited along the same active fault system.},

	abstract = {Prospective hydrocarbon-bearing zones in the subject gas shale are characterized by gas entrapped in the sediment matrix with some additional openfracture component. This gas is economically recovered by horizontal drilling and fracturing. However, well placement close to faults is a significant risk factor due to expected mineralization of the fault and nearby shales and due to the risk of any fracture completions being “captured” by nearby faults. A wide azimuth {3D} survey was acquired to highlight areas exhibiting seismic velocity anisotropy for detection of open fractures. Sweet spots would be areas of anomalously low Poisson's ratio ({PR)}, away from faults, with (in this particular shale) high velocity anisotropy. This study documents the results of an integrated workflow of data processing, pre-stack seismic inversion and Ant Tracking to successfully characterize faults and fractures and to identify sweet spots in the subject gas shale. During data processing, azimuthal anisotropy analysis was done to determine the dominant direction of Vfast and Vslow. In general, there is good agreement between the azimuthal seismic data processing velocity analysis and Ant Tracking results. Corrections for {HTI} medium were applied prior to {VTI} anisotropic Kirchhoff prestack time migration ({KPSTM).} Two full azimuth {3D} seismic volumes were created: a prestack volume as input for inversion and a stacked volume as input for Ant Tracking. Simultaneous {AVO} inversion was done on prestack data to invert for acoustic impedance (Al) and Poisson's ratio ({PR).} A blind test of the inverted attributes is very encouraging. Areas of low {PR} away from faults are thought to be promising hydrocarbon leads or prospects. Ant Tracking reduces the risk of drilling near faults by providing a high resolution image of fractures and faults beyond what can be interpreted from conventional seismic data. The resulting integration of Poisson's ratio, anisotropy, and Ant Tracking results provide effective delineation of areas with superior porosity/charge, areas with open fractures, and areas with faulting, outlining likely sweet spots as well as areas better avoided in drilling.},

Narrow margins are characterized by a large bounding fault ({\textgreater}4 km throw) near the shelf edge; a sharp transition zone (10-20 km wide) from normal thickness to substantially thinned continental crust or oceanic crust; where the total width of extended continental crust is usually less than 100 km. Wide continental margins are characterized by a broad continental shelf and a wide zone (50-600 km) of thinned crust with an even distribution of faults. Wide margins usually have a more gentle continental shelf and slope. Narrow-narrow, wide-wide, and wide-narrow conjugate margin pairs exist in the South Atlantic and are suggested to be controlled mainly by the opening kinematics and the thermal structure of the lithosphere during rifting. Basement structure and strain rate appear to have exerted little control on the style of margin extension. Although basement architecture appears to control the trend of the initial rifts, the positions of fracture zones which separate narrow and wide segments, and the rate of lateral rift propagation.},

However, for a given mass of soil, a relationship between these two constitutive models could be obtained, providing a more satisfactory approach. Actually experimental results show some common features in the behaviour of body and interfaces in geomaterials. The dependancy of the dilatancy to the mean effective pressure is a good example. The purpose of our study is to propose a cyclic interface constitutive model derived on the basis of an elastoplastic body constitutive law. Usually, stick, slip, debonding and rebonding of the interface happen during subsequent loadings and unloadings. Cyclic loading functions with a memory of the last loading reversal are used to model these features. Finally the model is entirely developed with respect to effective stress vectors and is thus especially suited for the analysis of the influence of the pore pressure.},

	abstract = {Complex patterns of veins, solution surfaces and faults in exposures of the Sevier Shale in the Appalachian fold and thrust belt, Tennessee, {U.S.A.}, result from the interplay between the remote state of stress and stress perturbations caused by slip across thrust faults. In order to gain a better understanding of this interplay and its consequences, a two-dimensional displacement discontinuity boundary-element model ({DDBEM)} is utilized to interpret structural assemblages from the Sevier Shale. A {DDBEM} of isolated faults and fault arrays shows that the local state of stress is controlled by the frictional resistance along the faults and the angle between the remote (applied) greatest compressive stress direction and the fault planes. Nowhere is this more evident than within the domains bounded by bed-parallel echelon thrust fault arrays. Here, contrasting structural patterns involving geologically contemporaneous cleavages and bedding-normal veins are recognized. The cleavages are oblique to the trend of the bed-parallel thrust fault arrays implying that the fault arrays were not frictionless during the dissolution process. The bedding-normal veins, however, indicate that the same fault arrays were principal stress planes and nearly frictionless during opening fracturing. Low frictional resistance is interpreted to be due to nearly lithostatic fluid pressures. These contrasting styles are interpreted to result from slip and inter-slip periods of deformation. When the fluid pressure was high, fault friction was low, and the faults slipped. Fracturing dominated the domains between the thrust fault arrays causing the veins to open and a decrease in the fluid pressure. During the inter-slip period the fluid pressure was low; the faults had significant frictional resistance; and pressure solution was the dominant deformation mechanism. The cycling between slip and inter-slip periods and respective states of stress may explain the non-orthogonal relationship between the co-existing veins and cleavages.},

	abstract = {The hydrofracturing technique is a recent development in the area of stress measurements in rock. Unlike most other methods, it does not measure strain at a point through the use of delicate instrumentation in the test-hole. Rather, it directly determines average stresses over large areas by recording two hydraulic pressures, one necessary to crack open a segment of the test-hole and the other required to keep the fracture open. To do so, it uses simple down-hole mechanical tools so that the method can be employed at any depth from the surface. Elementary elastic relationships exist between recorded pressures and in-situ stresses, and between fracture direction and stress orientation. Our laboratory experiments have confirmed these relationships, and in the last five years we have conducted a number of successful field measurements throughout the United States and elsewhere, at depths between very near the surface and 5000 m. The results of these measurements, details of which are given in the paper, have been used in studying earthquake control problems (Rangely, Colorado), underground power station design (California, South Carolina), hard rock tunnel design (Wisconsin), and geology and plate tectonics (all the measurements and particularly those in Michigan and Iceland). A general uniformity of maximum principal stress direction throughout the continental United States has been established. Stress magnitudes are affected by regional geologic conditions but generally show linear increases with depth.},

	abstract = {Power-law distributions occur in many situations of scientific interest and have significant consequences for our understanding of natural and man-made phenomena. Unfortunately, the detection and characterization of power laws is complicated by the large fluctuations that occur in the tail of the distribution -- the part of the distribution representing large but rare events -- and by the difficulty of identifying the range over which power-law behavior holds. Commonly used methods for analyzing power-law data, such as least-squares fitting, can produce substantially inaccurate estimates of parameters for power-law distributions, and even in cases where such methods return accurate answers they are still unsatisfactory because they give no indication of whether the data obey a power law at all. Here we present a principled statistical framework for discerning and quantifying power-law behavior in empirical data. Our approach combines maximum-likelihood fitting methods with goodness-of-fit tests based on the Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic and likelihood ratios. We evaluate the effectiveness of the approach with tests on synthetic data and give critical comparisons to previous approaches. We also apply the proposed methods to twenty-four real-world data sets from a range of different disciplines, each of which has been conjectured to follow a power-law distribution. In some cases we find these conjectures to be consistent with the data while in others the power law is ruled out.},

	abstract = {The curvature of structured geological surfaces can be used to assess the degree of strain they have undergone. In many hydrocarbon reservoirs, this strain is expressed as brittle fracturing that may significantly impact reservoir performance. Here we describe the development of an algorithm for measuring the curvature of gridded surfaces derived from seismic data. For any grid node, the algorithm calculates the magnitude and orientations of the two principal curvatures, K1 and K2, from which other curvature measurements can be derived, such as Gaussian curvature and summed absolute curvature (K1 + K2). The algorithm has also been used to generate plots of summed absolute curvature as a function of grid node separation (k versus \{lambda\}). These spectral' or k\{lambda\} plots can be generated for each grid node and allow the definition of short-wavelength, high-amplitude noise cut-off lengths. They also deliver intermediate wavelength features such as fault drag or buckle folding and the identification of long-wavelength (basin-scale) curvatures. Portions of these data can be collapsed into single values by calculating the integral of the k\{lambda\} curve. Further filters designed to screen the effects of background tectonic, or non-tectonic, curvatures can be applied to the k\{lambda\} integral. This algorithm has been tested using data from several North Sea chalk fields. A range of alternative types of curvature and curvature spectra are compared with other approaches to curvature calculation and other factors relevant to the calibration of such techniques in terms of the distribution of brittle fractures in sedimentary rocks. The k\{lambda\} integral provides a relatively simple approach to calculating the degree of multi-wavelength strain present at a particular grid node. Freeing algorithms from the restriction of the arbitrarily' selected minimum grid node spacing is a key step towards calibrating measured curvature against strain mechanisms. However, care must be taken to separate intrinsic and tectonic curvatures when generating and interpreting k\{lambda\} plots and their integrals.},

The situation where cracks are partially filled with liquid (and part with gas) is very different from either extreme of dry or liquid-filled cracks since the liquid is forced to flow laterally within a crack, at the expense of the more compressible gas, by tensions or compressions imposed normal to the plane of the crack.

	abstract = {Elastic-wave propagation in fractured and cracked media depends on the dominant spatial orientation of the discontinuities. Consequently, compressional and shear-wave velocities can give valuable information about the orientation of the cracks. The main goal of this work is to estimate the preferential fracture orientation based on an analysis of cross-correlated S-wave seismograms and Thomsen parameters. For this purpose, we analyzed ultrasonic measurements of elastic (P and S) waves in a physical-modeling experiment with an artificially anisotropic cracked model. The solid matrix of the model consisted of epoxy-resin; small rubber strips simulate cracks with a compliant fill. The anisotropic cracked model consists of three regions, each with a different fracture orientation. We used the rotation of the S-wave polarizations for a cross-correlation analysis of the orientations, and P- and S-wave measurements to evaluate the weak anisotropic parameters γ and ε. The shear and compressional wave sources had dominant frequencies of 90 {kHz} and 120 {kHz.} These frequencies correspond to long wavelengths compared to the spacing between layers, indicating a nearly effective-media behavior. Integrating the results from cross-correlation with anisotropic parameter analysis, we were able to estimate the fracture orientation in our anisotropic cracked physical model. The γ parameter showed good agreement with the cross-correlation analysis and, beyond that, provided additional information about the crack orientation that cross-correlation alone did not fully resolve. Moreover, our results show that the shear waves are much more strongly influenced by, and can thus contain more information about, crack orientation than compressional waves.},

The long-range spatial characteristics of these correlations provide strong support for the reservoirs being close to a point of criticality, at least during their development lifetimes.

	doi = {10.1016/j.earscirev.2008.10.003},
	abstract = {Sequence stratigraphy emphasizes facies relationships and stratal architecture within a chronological framework. Despite its wide use, sequence stratigraphy has yet to be included in any stratigraphic code or guide. This lack of standardization reflects the existence of competing approaches (or models) and confusing or even conflicting terminology. Standardization of sequence stratigraphy requires the definition of the fundamental model-independent concepts, units, bounding surfaces and workflow that outline the foundation of the method. A standardized scheme needs to be sufficiently broad to encompass all possible choices of approach, rather than being limited to a single approach or model.
A sequence stratigraphic framework includes genetic units that result from the interplay of accommodation and sedimentation (i.e., forced regressive, lowstand and highstand normal regressive, and transgressive), which are bounded by [`]sequence stratigraphic' surfaces. Each genetic unit is defined by specific stratal stacking patterns and bounding surfaces, and consists of a tract of correlatable depositional systems (i.e., a [`]systems tract'). The mappability of systems tracts and sequence stratigraphic surfaces depends on depositional setting and the types of data available for analysis. It is this high degree of variability in the precise expression of sequence stratigraphic units and bounding surfaces that requires the adoption of a methodology that is sufficiently flexible that it can accommodate the range of likely expressions. The integration of outcrop, core, well-log and seismic data affords the optimal approach to the application of sequence stratigraphy. Missing insights from one set of data or another may limit the [`]resolution' of the sequence stratigraphic interpretation.
A standardized workflow of sequence stratigraphic analysis requires the identification of all genetic units and bounding surfaces that can be delineated objectively, at the selected scale of observation, within a stratigraphic section. Construction of this model-independent framework of genetic units and bounding surfaces ensures the success of the sequence stratigraphic method. Beyond this, the interpreter may make model-dependent choices with respect to which set of sequence stratigraphic surfaces should be elevated in importance and be selected as sequence boundaries. In practice, the succession often dictates which set of surfaces are best expressed and hold the greatest utility at defining sequence boundaries and quasi-chronostratigraphic units. The nomenclature of systems tracts and sequence stratigraphic surfaces is also model-dependent to some extent, but a standard set of terms is recommended to facilitate communication between all practitioners.},

	abstract = {We describe the detailed faulting process of a naturally healed fault containing geometric and mechanical asperities in a granitic porphyry sample, based on data collected with a high-speed acoustic emission ({AE)} waveform recording system. Asperity failure is examined using the detailed spatio-temporal distribution of {AE} hypocenters. The initial phase of {AE} activity is also examined using high dynamic range waveforms. Our experimental results indicate that quasi-static nucleation of the heterogeneous fault is associated with the failure of asperities on the fault plane. The fracturing of an asperity is characterized by a dense spatial clustering of {AE} events and a changing b-value (b, hereinafter), which is manifest in three typical stages of failure as follows: (1) foreshocks exhibiting a decrease in b, (2) a period of mainshocks corresponding to a minimum in b, and (3) aftershocks of increasing b. The progressive fracture of several coupled asperities results in short-term precursory fluctuations in both b and {AE} rate. Furthermore, some {AE} events possess similar dynamic rupture features to those of earthquakes, having an initial phase associated with the transition from quasi-dynamic to dynamic rupture. We conclude based on these experimental observations that fault rupture has hierarchical characteristics. Quasi-static nucleation of fault rupture represents dynamic fracture of the asperities on the fault plane; likewise, a quasi-static nucleation process characterized by dynamic microfracturing precedes the fracture of an asperity. Since dynamic motions are easier to detect remotely than static deformations, understanding the hierarchical processes underlying fault rupture may thus be helpful for elucidating quasi-static nucleation at larger scales in terms of the dynamic rupture of the asperities at smaller scales. Careful studies of asperity failure in the lab may guide future seismic studies of large asperities on natural faults, potentially making it possible to recognize the final preparation stage before a large earthquake.},

The tests were performed in orthogonal boreholes at the Äspö Hard Rock Laboratory ({HRL)}, Oskarshamn, Sweden. The two most common methods to measure in situ stress are the overcoring and hydraulic fracturing methods. Among the three tests, two are carried out using the overcoring method, the third uses the hydraulic fracturing method. The overcoring equipment's are the {AECL's} Deep Doorstopper Gauge System ({DDGS)} and {SwedPower's} Triaxial Strain Cell (Borre Probe). The measured results could be verified against known conditions at the Äspö {HRL.} The results from the three in situ stress measurement methods illustrate the complexity of determining the in situ stresses in a rock mass.

			Résumé
			
			Ce rapport est le premier des deux qui présentent la recherche récente des contraintes  in-situ  dans les roches sédimentaires, et les applications de la géologie et du génie pétrolier de ces données. La partie première décrit et addresse les méthodes les plus populaires pour mesurer les contraintes contemporaines qui affectent les roches sédimentaires en termes de S v  (contrainte principale verticale), de S Hmin  (contrainte majeure horizontale) et de S Hmin  (contrainte mineure horizontale). Pour obtenir les grandeurs des contraintes, on peut examiner les diagraphies dedensité (S v ), utiliser les fractures hydrauliques ou des essais de pression sous le sabot de cimentation (S Hmin ), aussitôt que les techniques analytiques exécutées sur des carottes (S Hmin , S Hmin ). Mortaiser les sondages offre une promesse pour les puits profonds (S Hmin , S Hmin ), mais la technique n'est pas encore operationelle. Près de la surface, on peut déduire les orientations des contraintes (S Hmin , S Hmin ) avec l'assistance d'un assortiment d'indicateurs géologiques, mais il est nécessaire de sélectionner les endroits avec précaution. Sous la surface, les orientations des contraintes principales sont fournies par les ovalisations despuits de forage (S Hmin , S Hmin ). des types particuliers de fractures des carottes (S Hmin , S Hmin ), par le discage des carottes (S Hmin , S Hmin ), par la dilatation des carottes (S Hmin , S Hmin ), des fractures hydrauliques (S Hmin ) et aussi les tremblements de terre (S Hmin ). L'anisotropie acoustique et la séparation des ondes transversales indiqueront l'orientationdes fractures microscopiques, mais les attitudes obtenues ne sont pas toujours en accord avec les axes des contraintes contemporaines. Toutes ces méthodes sont courantes, particulièrement dans l'industrie pétrolière.}

	abstract = {The distributions of contact area and void space in single fractures in granite rock have been determined experimentally by making metal casts of the void spaces between the fracture surfaces under normal loads. The resulting metal casts on 52 cm diameter core samples show a complex geometry for the flow paths through the fracture. This geometry is analyzed using finite-size scaling. The spanning probabilities and percolation probabilities of the metal casts are calculted as functions of observation scale. Under the highest stresses of 33 {MPa} and 85 {MPa} there is a significant size-dependence of the geometric flow properties for observation scales smaller than 2 mm. Based on this data, the macroscopic percolation properties of the extended fracture can be well represented by relatively small core samples, even under normal stresses larger than 33 {MPa.} The metal casts also have rich multifractal structure that changes with changing stress.},

It is therefore important to obtain as much information as possible about the nature of the fractures within the reservoir, especially between the wells. In this paper, Amplitude versus Offset and Azimuth ({AVAZ)} analysis of {3D} seismic data are used to determine fracture strike and density at, and around, well locations in the Manderson Field. The results of these analyses are then compared to fracture strike analyses from oriented cores for these wells, to analogues found in outcrop, and to outcrop at the Zeisman Dome - 10 miles to the {SE} of Manderson Field. It is found that the {AVAZ} fracture analysis results compare favorably to these other methods of determining fracture strike and density while also providing important information about fracturing between the wells.},

	abstract = {Understanding the state of stress in the earth is important for a broad range of engineering and geological problems. To obtain the state of stress in boreholes where conditions are such that conventional stress measurement techniques are impossible, we have used recent developments in the analysis of compressive and tensile wellbore failure in an integrated stress measurement strategy, involving also direct measurement of the least principal stress. The analysis is carried out in the two deep boreholes in the Siljan Ring area of the Baltic Shield. The Gravberg-1 borehole reached 6779 m true vertical depth ({TVD)} in the Siljan region, central Sweden, and the Stenberg-1 borehole, drilled 10 km to the south of Gravberg-1, was completed at 6529 m {TVD.} Analysis of vertical, drilling-induced tensile fractures in the nondeviating part of the Gravberg-1 well indicated that one principal stress is vertical and thus could be calculated from density estimates. Borehole breakouts and tensile fractures indicated that the average direction of the maximum horizontal stress, {SH}, is {N72°W±7°} in Gravberg-1 and {N53°W±9°} in the Stenberg-1 well. The direction of {SH} is on average very stable in both wells. Lower bound limits on the magnitude of the minimum horizontal stress, Sh, in the Gravberg-1 well were obtained from controlled and uncontrolled hydraulic fracturing and formation integrity tests. At 5 km depth in the Gravberg-1 borehole the minimum horizontal stress is approximately two-thirds of the vertical stress. We estimated the magnitude of the maximum horizontal stress in Gravberg-1 on the basis of drilling-induced tensile fractures identified in the borehole. {SH} was estimated by calculating the stress at the borehole wall necessary to cause tensile failure of the formation, incorporating our lower bound Sh estimates, corrections for the cooling of the wellbore by drilling fluids and differential fluid pressures. Our results indicate a strike-slip faulting regime in the Siljan area and that the state of stress is in frictional equilibrium with a coefficient of friction in the range 0.5 to 0.6.},

We identified faults and fractures from electrical images of the borehole wall obtained by downhole logging but also from photographs and descriptions of retrieved core samples, and measured the variations in the principal horizontal stress orientation ascertained from borehole breakouts observed on the electrical images in the vicinity of the faults and fractures. Identification of geological structures (faults, fractures, and lithologic boundaries) by electrical images only is difficult and may sometimes yield incorrect results. In a novel approach, therefore, we used both the electrical images and core photographs to identify geological structures. We found four patterns of stress orientation change, or no change, in the vicinity of faults and fractures in {TCDP} hole B: (i) abrupt (discontinuous) rotation in the vicinity of faults or fractures; (ii) gradual rotation; (iii) suppression of breakouts at faults, fractures, or lithologic boundaries; and (iv) no change in the stress orientation. We recognized stress fluctuations, that is, heterogeneous mesoscale ({\textgreater}= 10 cm) stress distributions with respect to both stress orientation and magnitude. In addition, we found that stress state changes occurred frequently in the vicinity of faults, fractures, and lithologic boundaries.},

	abstract = {A fundamental understanding of the relation between stress concentrations at grain contacts and microfractures in granular aggregates is obtained through two-dimensional photomechanical model studies and is tested through observational studies of experimentally deformed sandstone discs, glass beads, and quartz sand.
In uncemented aggregates, the state of stress in each grain is controlled by the manner in which the applied load is transmitted across grain contacts. The angles between lines connecting pairs of contacts and the axis of the principal load acting at the boundaries of the aggregate determine which of all contacts will be most highly stressed or "critical". Microfractures follow that maximum principal stress trajectory which connects critical contacts, and they propagate through those points where the magnitude of the local maximum stress difference is the greatest. Microfractures, therefore, are extension fractures. It then follows that both the locations and orientations of fractures can be predicted if the state of stress in the grains is known.
Positioning of critical contacts depends primarily on sorting, packing, grain shapes, and the boundary load conditions applied to the aggregate. Some critical contacts and, therefore, microfractures tend to join together in a series or "chain". Orientations of chains are most strongly influenced by the direction of the maximum compressive load at the boundary of the aggregate. A hydrostatic load applied on the boundaries of an aggregate can cause microfracturing within grains. Orientations for microfractures and contact lines are random in poorly sorted aggregates, but they are influenced by packing in well sorted aggregates.
Grains of cemented aggregates are more highly stressed at their centers than at contacts. By analogy, microfracture orientations depend strongly on the position of the greatest load axis and only slightly on the low-magnitude stress concentrations at contacts. These microfractures parallel the greatest principal stress trajectory in regions where the magnitude of the maximum stress difference is greatest. These observations lead to the conclusion that fractures in grains of cemented aggregates are also extension fractures and should exhibit a higher degree of preferred orientation than in uncemented counterparts.
These conclusions hold when cementing materials have about the same elastic moduli as the grains. Cements may be so weak that the aggregate behaves as if it were uncemented in terms of microfracture fabric, or so stiff that the major part of the load is transmitted by the cement, and the composite is no longer an aggregate in the mechanical sense.},

	abstract = {Fault seal can arise from reservoir/nonreservoir juxtaposition or by development of fault rock having high entry pressure. The methodology for evaluating these possibilities uses detailed seismic mapping and well analysis. A first-order seal analysis involves identifying reservoir juxtaposition areas over the fault surface by using the mapped horizons and a refined reservoir stratigraphy defined by isochores at the fault surface. The second-order phase of the analysis assesses whether the sand/sand contacts are likely to support a pressure difference. We define two types of lithology-dependent attributes: gouge ratio and smear factor. Gouge ratio is an estimate of the proportion of fine-grained material entrained into the fault gouge from the wall rocks. Smear factor methods (including clay smear potential and shale smear factor) estimate the profile thickness of a shale drawn along the fault zone during faulting. All of these parameters vary over the fault surface, implying that faults cannot simply be designated sealing or nonsealing. An important step in using these parameters is to calibrate them in areas where across-fault pressure differences are explicitly known from wells on both sides of a fault. Our calibration for a number of data sets shows remarkably consistent results, despite their diverse settings (e.g., Brent province, Niger Delta, Columbus basin). For example, a shale gouge ratio of about 20\% (volume of shale in the slipped interval) is a typical threshold between minimal across-fault pressure difference and significant seal.},

	abstract = {We present and test a new technique for determining the far-field virgin state of stress near the {TauTona} gold mine. The technique we used to constrain the far-field stress state follows an iterative forward modelling approach that combines observations of drilling-induced borehole failures in borehole images, boundary element modelling of the mining-induced stress perturbations, and forward modelling of borehole failures based on the results of the boundary element modelling. Using this approach, we constrained a range of principal stress orientations and magnitudes that are consistent with all the observed failures and other stress indicators. We found that the state of stress is a normal faulting regime (Sv*[greater-or-equal, {slanted]SHmax*[greater-or-equal}, {slanted]Shmin*)} with principal stress orientations that are slightly deviated from vertical and horizontal and, therefore, denoted with a (*). The maximum principal stress, Sv*, is deviated {\textasciitilde}10° from vertical plunging towards the {NNW} with a magnitude gradient of {\textasciitilde}27 {MPa/km.} The intermediate principal stress, {SHmax*}, is inclined {\textasciitilde}10° from horizontal plunging towards an azimuth of {\textasciitilde}156° and has a magnitude gradient of {\textasciitilde}24 {MPa/km.} The least principal stress, Shmin*, is inclined {\textasciitilde}5° from horizontal plunging towards an azimuth of 247° and has a magnitude gradient of {\textasciitilde}14 {MPa/km.} This stress state indicates that the crust is in a state of frictional faulting equilibrium, such that normal faulting is likely to occur on cohesionless pre-existing fault planes that are optimally oriented to the stress field. Modelling of breakout rotations and gaps in breakout occurrence associated with recent fault slip on critically stressed faults located {\textgreater}100 m from the mine further confirmed this stress state.},

Sports Exerc., Vol. 41, No. 10 pp. 1831-1841, 2009. Purpose: Although proprioceptive and neuromuscular exercises are considered to be pail and parcel of rehabilitation programs after sport injuries, there is in uncertainty regarding the effectiveness of corresponding training interventions. The objective of this review was to evaluate the effectiveness of proprioceptive and neuromuscular training ({PT/NT)} for the treatment of ankle, knee, and shoulder joint injuries. Methods: Two independent reviewers performed a literature search in various databases and reference lists of articles. Data of included trials were then extracted, and methodological quality was assessed by using predetermined forms. Results: Fifteen trials met the inclusion criteria. {PT/NT} was effective at increasing functionality as well as at decreasing the incidence of recurrent injuries and "giving way" episodes after ankle sprains and in conservative treatment of anterior cruciate ligament injuries. However, conflicting results or no efficacy of training were reported for static postural control, joint position sense, neuromuscular control, joint laxity, and lower extremity strength. No study that examined {PT/NT} after shoulder injuries was found. Conclusions: From this review, it call be concluded that proprioceptive and neuromuscular interventions after ankle and knee joint injuries call be effective for the prevention of recurrent injuries and the improvement of joint functionality.},

These boards were coupled together with the help of a pressure device and uniaxial stress was gradually increased while time arrival and velocity measurements were repeated. Results show maximum increase in compressional and shear wave velocities ranging from 4\% to 10\% in different directions as a function of increasing uniaxial stress. Anisotropic parameter gamma generally diminished with increasing pressure and ranged from 0\% to 33\%. We observed anisotropic behavior attributable to both orthorhombic and {VTI} symmetries. Polar anisotropy behavior is due primarily to layering or bedding and tends to increase with pressure. Certain anisotropic parameters however unveil inherent orthotropic symmetry of phenolic.},

In the southeast continental margin of Brazil, a seismic zone extends from Rio Grande do Sul to Espírito Santo, with seismic activity occurring mainly along the continental slope and suggesting a close relationship with flexural stresses caused by the weight of the sediments. In this region, earthquakes with magnitudes larger than 5 mb occur every 20–25 yr, on average. The focal mechanism solutions of previous earthquakes in this zone indicated reverse faulting on planes dipping approximately 45° with horizontal P-axes. The recent 5.2 mb earthquake of 2008 April 23 occurred 125 km south of São Vicente and was well recorded by many stations in {SE} Brazil, as well as at teleseismic distances in North America and Africa. Its focal depth was 17 km, locating the hypocentre in the lower crust. A well-determined focal mechanism solution shows one vertical nodal plane and one subhorizontal nodal plane. The P- and T-axes exhibit large dips, which were confirmed by a regional moment tensor inversion. This unusual orientation of the fault mechanism can be attributed to a rotation of the principal stress directions in the lower crust caused by flexural effects due to the load of recent sedimentation.},

The solutions are in the form of a surface integral over a unit sphere for 3-D cases and in the form of a contour integral over a unit circle for 2-D cases. The integrals have a simple structure that can be interpreted as a superposition of plane waves. The wavefields can be separated into singular and regular parts. The singular parts correspond to the elastostatic fundamental solutions. The regular parts are bounded continuous functions. The integrals have been evaluated numerically for several examples. The results presented in this paper have direct applications to the formulation of boundary-integral equations for bodies of anisotropic materials and for the subsequent solution of these equations by the boundary-element method.},

In 1994, a demonstration seismic project was conducted at the field to show how exploration for, and the characterization of, naturally fractured gas reservoirs can be more effective through the integrated use of seismic techniques. Study of field exposures, well logs, and regional stress indicators prior to the seismic survey indicated a high degree of preferential orientation to the dominant fracture trend at the field. The seismic survey consisted of two crossing, nine-component surface seismic lines and a nine-component vertical seismic profile. The compression, and shear-wave surface seismic both recorded anisotropies that were related to the presence and azimuth of the natural fracturing. The surface seismic results were supported by results from the nine-component vertical seismic profile. This program demonstrates the potential offered by the use of integrated seismic and geological techniques for the analysis of both land and marine naturally fractured reservoirs; furthermore, it demonstrates the possibilities of reviewing existing databases containing compression-wave surface seismic data for fracture information.},

Specifically, we compared the effects of 2 preoperative interventions on quadriceps strength and functional outcomes. {BACKGROUND:} The percentage of athletes who return to sports after {ACL} reconstruction varies considerably, possibly due to differential responses after acute {ACL} rupture and different management. Prognostic data for noncopers following {ACL} reconstruction is absent in the literature. {METHODS:} Forty noncopers were randomly assigned to receive either progressive quadriceps strength-training exercises ({STR} group) or perturbation training in conjunction with strength-training exercises ({PERT} group) for 10 preoperative rehabilitation sessions, Postoperative rehabilitation was similar between groups. Data on quadriceps strength indices [(involved limb/uninvolved limb force) X 100], 4 hop score indices, and 2 self-report questionnaires were collected preoperatively and 3, 6, and 12 months postoperatively. Mann-Whitney U tests were used to compare functional differences between the groups. Chi-square tests were used to compare frequencies of functional criteria and reasons for differences in performance between groups postoperatively. {RESULTS:} Functional outcomes were not different between groups, except a greater number of patients in the {PERT} group achieved global rating scores (current knee function expressed as percentage of overall knee function prior to injury) necessary to pass return-to-sports criteria 6 and 12 months after surgery. Mean scores for each functional outcome met return-to-sports criteria 6 and 12 months postoperatively. Frequency counts of individual data, however, indicated that 5\% of noncopers passed {RTS} criteria at 3, 48\% at 6, and 78\% at 12 months after surgery. {CONCLUSION:} Functional outcomes suggest that a subgroup of noncopers require additional supervised rehabilitation to pass stringent criteria to return to sports.},

Based on the distribution of facies associations and growth structures in the alluvial-fan deposits, and using marker levels and erosional surfaces, the tectono-sedimentary evolution of the basin margin is discussed. On a long timescale, the stratigraphic pattern in the alluvial-fan deposits mainly records the tectonic activity in the catchment, and subordinate out-of-syncline thrusts in the basin margin. On an intermediate timescale, evolution in the drainage area controls the spatial evolution of the alluvial fans and some minor changes in depositional facies. High-frequency cycles record aggradation-stabilization sequences, resulting in vertically superimposed alluvial-fan bodies more probably tectonically controlled, whereas alternation between conglomerates-siltstones at the scale of interbedding most probably reflects climatic cycles.},

The surface roughness of rock joints depends on their mode of origin, and on the mineralogy of the rock. Amongst the roughest joints will be those that formed in intrusive rocks in a tensile brittle manner, and amongst the smoothest the planar cleavage surface in slates. The range of friction angles exhibited by this spectrum will vary from about 75° or 80° down to 20° or 25°, the maximum values being very dependent on the normal stress, due to the strongly curved nature of the peak strength envelopes for rough unfilled joints.
Direct shear tests performed on model tension fractures have provided a very realistic picture of the behaviour of unfilled joints at the roughest end of the joint spectrum. The peak shear strength of rough--undulating joints such as tension surfaces can now be predicted with acceptable accuracy from a knowledge of only one parameter, namely the effective joint wall compressive strength or {JCS} value. For an unweathered joint this will be simply the unconfined compression strength of the unweathered rock. However in most cases joint walls will be weathered to some degree. Methods of estimating the strength of the weathered rock are discussed. The predicted values of shear strength compare favourably with experimental results reported in the literature, both for weathered and unweathered rough joints.
The shear strength of unfilled joints of intermediate roughness presents a problem since at present there is insufficient detailed reporting of test results. In an effort to remedy this situation, a simple roughness classification method has been devised which has a sliding scale of roughness. The curvature of the proposed strength envelopes reduces as the roughness coefficient reduces, and also varies with the strength of the weathered joint wall or unweathered rock, whichever is relevant. Values of the Coulomb parameters c and [Phi] fitted to the curves between the commonly used normal stress range of 5-20 kg/cm2 appear to agree quite closely with experimental results.
The presence of water is found in practice to reduce the shear strength of rough unfilled joints but hardly to affect the strength of planar surfaces. This surprising experimental result is also predicted by the proposed criterion for peak strength. The shear strength depends on the compressive strength which is itself reduced by the presence of water. The sliding scale of roughness incorporates a reduced contribution from the compressive strength as the joint roughness reduces. Based on the same model, it is possible to draw an interesting analogy between the effects of weathering, saturation, time to failure, and scale, on the shear strength of non-planar joints. Increasing these parameters causes a reduction in the compressive strength of the rock, and hence a reduction in the peak shear strength. Rough--undulating joints are most affected and smooth--nearly planar joints least of all.},

	abstract = {Observations from deep boreholes at several locations worldwide indicate that (i) hydrostatic pore pressures persist to depths of as much as 12 km in the upper crust, (ii) the brittle crust is in a state of failure equilibrium according to Coulomb frictional-failure theory, and (iii) bulk permeability is high -- 10-17-10-16 m2 -- apparently due to fluid flow along critically stressed faults. As a result of these factors, the brittle crust is stronger than it would be under near-lithostatic pore pressure conditions.
This result provides a constraint on models of lithospheric deformation. Postulating that the upper and lower crust and lithospheric mantle are totally coupled and that the total strength of the lithosphere is equal to the magnitude of tectonic driving forces ({\textasciitilde}3×1012 N m-1), we have calculated lithospheric strain rates under representative thermal and rheological conditions such that the integrated differential stress over the entire thickness of the lithosphere equals the plate driving force. For a strike-slip stress state and surface heat flow of 60±6 {mW} m-2, average strain rates are approximately 10-18 s-1 under hydrostatic upper crustal pore pressure conditions, and approximately 10-15 s-1 under near-lithostatic pore pressures. The latter strain rates are higher than either observed geodetically using very long baseline interferometry ({VLBI)}, or estimated on the basis of plate tectonic reconstructions. Hence we argue that hydrostatic upper crustal pore pressures enable lithospheric plates to behave rigidly over time scales of tens to hundreds of millions of years.},

The aim was to determine how compliance scales with fracture size and, specifically, how laboratory measurements of fracture compliance compared with field estimates from sonic and seismic data. A test site was constructed, consisting of three 40 m vertical boreholes drilled in the floor of a Carboniferous Limestone quarry. Detailed knowledge of the rocks in the test area was obtained from core analysis, wireline logging and local area fracture mapping. Seismic cross-hole surveys were performed using a sparker source with a dominant frequency of 2000 Hz and hydrophone receivers. The rocks had a compressional-wave velocity anisotropy of 10\%, which was attributed to the presence of predominantly horizontal, partially open fractures. Estimates of normal fracture compliance within a range from 2.5 × 10−13 {m/Pa} to 3.5 × 10−12 {m/Pa} were obtained from both the cross-hole data and the sonic-log data. This is an order of magnitude greater than values obtained from laboratory experiments which are reported elsewhere.},

The sedimentary record of the North American craton from late Precambrian to present is characterized by six major unconformities. These interregional unconformities subdivide the cratonic stratigraphic column into six sequences—major rock-stratigraphic units (of higher than group, megagroup, or supergroup rank) which can be identified, where preserved, in all cratonic interior areas. At the cratonic margins the bounding unconformities tend to disappear in continuous successions, and the cratonic sequences are replaced by others controlled by events in the marginal basins and eugeosynclinal borders.
Although the time values of the unconformities vary widely because of differences in degree of nondeposition and amount of erosion, the approximate dates of the regressional maxima represented are: (1) very late Precambrian, (2) early Middle Ordovician, (3) early Middle Devonian, (4) “post-Elvira” Mississippian, (5) early Middle Jurassic, and (6) late Paleocene. A seventh major regression is now in progress.},

The experiments were performed on a physical model consisting of two sets of fractures. The first set consisted of orientated rubber inclusions simulating weak material-filled cracks. The second set consisted of a system of closely spaced parallel fractures simulated by thin plates of epoxy resin, superimposed orthogonally on the first set. Three cases of fracture orientations within the model were identified and studied. Case 1 is analogous to a jointed fracture reservoir with one vertical set of fluid-filled cracks or fractures and one non-filled horizontal set. This case is referred to as {JFV.} Case 2 is analogous to a double fracture reservoir with one horizontal set of fluid-filled fractures or cracks and one non-filled vertical set. This is referred to as {DFH.} Case 3 is analogous to a double fracture reservoir with two vertical sets of fractures or cracks, with only one fluid-filled. Case 3 is referred to as {DFV.} A pulse transmission method was performed on all three modelled cases along the three principal axes. A directional variation in the compressional- and shear-wave velocities, as well as distinct shear-wave splitting, was observed. The elastic constants for each case were determined and differences between them were noted and compared with the controlled results of both layered (transverse isotropy, {TI)} and vertically fractured (azimuthally anisotropic models, {VF)} media. The differences in elastic moduli and velocities indicate the potential of recognizing the different fracture orientations and suggest an approach to designing a method of drilling to further enhance oil recovery and reservoir exploitation.},

We analyze the geometrical relationship between the plunges of P, B, and T axes on one hand, and the rake of slip and dip of nodal planes on the other hand. We show that the rake and dip level curves correspond to trajectories of the vertical direction along great and small circles with respect to the frame of the P, B, and T axes. This shows that dip-slip faulting is compatible with vertical P or T axes, but does not require it, and instead requires horizontal B axes. It also shows that strike-slip faulting does not require vertical B axes, but P and T axes with equal plunges. This also reveals that focal mechanisms where P, B, and T axes all have moderate plunge correspond to two very different types of nodal planes: a steeply dipping one with oblique slip and a moderately dipping one with strike-slip. Seismically active and moderately dipping strike-slip faults are to be found among these events.},

Design: Cohort study. Setting: {ACL} injured individuals treated at a University Hospital and an outpatient clinic in Oslo, Norway. Participants: Seventy-three individuals with complete unilateral rupture of the {ACL} scheduled for reconstruction with a bone-patellar-bone autograft were included in the study, from where 60 were available for two-year follow up and included in the final analyses. Interventions: Not applicable. Main outcome measurements: Identification of baseline independent variables that may predict knee function assessed with the Cincinnati Knee Score as dependent variable two years after {ACL} reconstruction. Results: Quadriceps muscle strength, meniscus injury and the Short-Form-36 Bodily Pain sub score were identified as significant predictors for knee function assessed from the Cincinnati Knee Score two years after {ACL} reconstruction. Individuals with preoperative quadriceps strength deficits above 20\% also had persistent significantly larger strength deficits two years after surgery. Conclusions: Preoperative quadriceps muscle strength deficits and meniscus injuries have significant negative consequences for the long-term functional outcome after {ACL} reconstruction. From our findings we suggest that {ACL} reconstruction should not be performed before quadriceps muscle strength deficits of the injured limb is less than 20\% of the uninjured limb.},

	abstract = {A simple practical method to characterize the strength and stiffness of jointed rock masses is presented in this paper. The empirical relations for the strength and stiffness of rock masses have been arrived based on the statistical analysis of a large amount of experimental data, which are used for representing the jointed rock mass as an equivalent continuum. The effect of joints in the rock mass is taken into account by a joint factor. These obtained relations are incorporated in a non-linear {FEM} code to represent the equivalent continuum analysis. The equivalent continuum model has been validated against experimental results for jointed rock masses with different joint fabric and joint orientation and also with the results from explicit modeling of joints using {FEM.} The developed model has also been applied to calculate the deformation around a large power station cavern in rhyolite rock at 200 m depth.},

	abstract = {Focal mechanisms of small earthquakes with magnitudes of about 3 in the {SE} Brazilian shield are calculated using {S/P} amplitude ratios. Low attenuation (Qp from 400 to 800) in the shield upper-crustal layers allowed sharp S arrivals to be recorded up to distances of 100 km. Besides P-wave polarities, {SH-wave} first motions were also used to constrain the nodal-plane orientations. Normal and reverse faulting mechanisms with strike-slip components were found. The inversion of four mechanisms to estimate the stress tensor indicated a strike-slip stress regime with roughly {E2013W-orientated} {03C31} and {N2013S} {03C33.} Both the orientations and the shape factor ({03C6=0.7)} of the inverted stress are in excellent agreement with theoretical predictions for that part of Brazil from the driving-force model of Coblentz \& Richardson (1996). Good agreement with the nature of the stress, as well as its orientation, was also found for the model of Meijer (1995). Both of these theoretical models include spreading stresses along the continent/ocean lithospheric transition. Because the earthquakes are more than 300 km from the continental shelf they should not be affected by the local flexural forces caused by sediment load in the marginal basins. The agreement between observed and theoretical stresses then confirms the importance of continental spreading forces in modelling intraplate stresses.},

	doi = {10.1190/1.1893040},
	abstract = {Seismically, an anisotropic medium is one in which the material properties governing elastic wave propagation vary with direction. The variation in these properties may result from crystalline anisotropy and/or preferred mineral alignment, a directional variation of isotropic properties due to an imposed stress differential, and/or a preferred fracture orientation (micro and/or macro) resulting in a quasi-elastic medium. In the case of fracture-induced anisotropy, as will be investigated here, the fractures cause a variation in P and S-wave velocities for propagation parallel and perpendicular to the fracture plane (similar to the ordinary and extraordinary rays in optically birefringent crystals). Hence, when a shear-wave enters a fractured media, the wave splits into two quasi-shear waves ({qSH} and {qSV).} These waves then propagate with different velocities and are polarized in different planes. Also, a quasi-P-wave {qP} is generated when a compressional wave propagates through a fractured medium. The direction of particle motion for the {qP} wave deviates from the propagation direction in all but the symmetry planes. Crampin (1978) and Crampin et al. (1980) used hodograms to identify shear-wave splitting resulting from propagation through an anisotropic media. A hodogram is a plot of the particle velocity in one direction versus that in another (usually orthogonal) direction as a function of time. From such a plot, the following information can be derived: (1) whether the particle motion is linearly or elliptically polarized; (2) in the case of elliptical polarization, what are the orientations of the principal symmetry planes; and (3) in the case of shear-wave splitting when the two velocities are known, what is the fracture orientation. To identify and describe fully wave polarization and splitting, a complete measure of the elastic wave field must be made. This is accomplished by using 3-component detectors to record the wave field. A 3-component {VSP} data set was recorded in central Texas. Analysis of elliptical particle motion measured in the {VSP} data indicated zones of possible anisotropy or fracturing in the subsurface. From the {VSP} data, orientation of the principal axes of anisotropy in the Austin and Buda units was determined.},

We propose here a critical review of the kinematic models published since Bullard et al., 1965, based on a series of constraints: new interpretation of the magnetic anomalies, seafloor isochrons, flow lines, fracture zones, continental and oceanic homologous structures and radiometric dating of igneous rocks. All of these models present numerous unexplained misfits (gaps, overlaps and misalignments). We present here a new evolution of the Equatorial and South Atlantic Ocean from the tightest reconstruction to Chron C34. This new model confirms the hypothesis of a northward propagation of the South American deformation proposed by Eagles, but rejuvenates slightly the ages for this propagation and refines the plate reconstructions. In particular, we highlight the role of the kinematic «buffer» Santos block, located between the salty Aptian Central segment in the North and the Volcanic Hauterivian Austral segment in the South. The new initial fit presented in this study represents the tightest reconstruction that could be obtained and constitutes the base canvas on which the problem of the continental margin genesis should be addressed.},

	abstract = {Ligament reconstruction is the current standard of care for active patients with an anterior cruciate ligament ({ACL)} rupture. Although the majority of {ACL} reconstruction ({ACLR)} surgeries successfully restore the mechanical stability of the injured knee, postsurgical outcomes remain widely varied. Less than half of athletes who undergo {ACLR} return to sport within the first year after surgery, and it is estimated that approximately 1 in 4 to 1 in 5 young, active athletes who undergo {ACLR} will go on to a second knee injury. The outcomes after a second knee injury and surgery are significantly less favorable than outcomes after primary injuries. As advances in graft reconstruction and fixation techniques have improved to consistently restore passive joint stability to the preinjury level, successful return to sport after {ACLR} appears to be predicated on numerous postsurgical factors. Importantly, a secondary {ACL} injury is most strongly related to modifiable postsurgical risk factors. Biomechanical abnormalities and movement asymmetries, which are more prevalent in this cohort than previously hypothesized, can persist despite high levels of functional performance, and also represent biomechanical and neuromuscular control deficits and imbalances that are strongly associated with secondary injury incidence. Decreased neuromuscular control and high-risk movement biomechanics, which appear to be heavily influenced by abnormal trunk and lower extremity movement patterns, not only predict first knee injury risk but also reinjury risk. These seminal findings indicate that abnormal movement biomechanics and neuromuscular control profiles are likely both residual to, and exacerbated by, the initial injury. Evidence-based medicine ({EBM)} strategies should be used to develop effective, efficacious interventions targeted to these impairments to optimize the safe return to high-risk activity.
In this Current Concepts article, the authors present the latest evidence related to risk factors associated with ligament failure or a secondary (contralateral) injury in athletes who return to sport after {ACLR.} From these data, they propose an {EBM} paradigm shift in postoperative rehabilitation and return-to-sport training after {ACLR} that is focused on the resolution of neuromuscular deficits that commonly persist after surgical reconstruction and standard rehabilitation of athletes.},

	doi = {10.1016/0040-1951(87)90205-8},
	abstract = {In various tectonic environments, extension of crustal parts and shear distortion has been accommodated by the rotation of an array of parallel faults. Because of its kinematic resemblance to the tilting of a row of books on a shelf, the tectonic process may be referred to as a "bookshelf" mechanism. Its most important manifestions are cross-faulting between normal faults or parallel wrench faults, the extension of deltaic slope deposits and all forms of tilted block tectonics.
Kinematically, there are two basic modes of the mechanism: (a) the "dilational" mode, where rotating faults tend to open up and possibly become paths for fluid migration and (b) the "domino" style where reclining faults remain closed. In both cases, formation and rotation of the faults may take place in one tectonic event. Fault displacements may therefore often remain small and difficult to detect. From the mechanical point of view, bookshelf operations that accommodate shearing between parallel and predominantly parallel moving rock boundaries ([`]bookshelf' mechanisms proper) have to be differentiated from those operations responding to an imposed crustal extension or shortening.
After a review of geological evidence the process is addressed from a geomechanical point of view in order to determine the geological operating conditions and controlling parameters.
The crucial mechanical factor in the bookshelf mechanism is the component of normal stress that acts in the direction of the imposed displacement component parallel to the driving boundary plates. In contrast to the usual assumption, the driving shear stress on the boundary plates not only depends on the normal stress on the plates, but it also varies with the value of the normal stress that acts inside the sheared material in the direction of the plate-parallel displacement component. It is the relationship between the two normal stresses that also determines the type of rotating parallel faults.
Large-scale rotation of parallel normal faults in domino style (tilted block tectonics) is primarily associated with the extension of ductile substrata. From mechanical arguments and sand box experiments it has been inferred how the process and in particular, the dip direction of the parallel faults, is controlled by the way substratal extension progresses, by means of the direction of a substratal squeeze flow, the presence of a surface slope, the strength anisotropy associated with fore-set beds and by the configuration of competent boundaries of the extending overburden.},

	abstract = {Fractures occur on a wide range of scales and are important in the study of hydrocarbon reservoirs. Seismic simulation by finite-difference modelling using an equivalent medium method can devise the elastic parameters of a cell intersected by a fracture as those of a medium with an equivalent seismic response. Numerical experiments confirm that diffractions from the fracture tips are a strong component of the total wavefield. However, a comparison of boxcar, linear, angular and elliptic tapering suggests that there is little dependence on shape because the energy involved in a single diffraction is much lower than the incident energy. An open, fluid filled fracture has stronger effect on the wavefield than the wet and dry, multiple crack models, because an open fracture would have a stronger dissimilarity to the background rock. The density of microcracks within a fracture also has strong effect on the seismic response, however the properties of those cracks are not significant to the overall seismic response. Considering a distribution of a large number of fractures, even when the overall density of fractures is held constant, longer fractures attenuate seismic energy more than smaller ones. For the orientation effect, fractures oriented in the direction of propagation seem to affect the wavefield more than those perpendicular because of the incident wave striking the fracture at an angle greater than the critical angle. Experiments on clustering of the fractures indicate that although clusters which are large compared to the wavelength may attenuate and ‘shield’ more than for a uniform distribution, smaller ones in fact attenuate less, because of the ‘healing’ effect. These are important results when trying to characterize the fracture properties including density, clustering, size and orientation of a fractured reservoir from field seismic data.},

	abstract = {The Upper Proterozoic Pan-African belts of Africa and Brasiliano belts of South America are assumed to have evolved from an elaborate system of continental rifts which formed on the West Gondwana continent 1100-1000 Ma ago. Reviews of the Damara belt, Kaoko belt, Gariep belt, Saldania belt, West Congolian belt, Lufilian Arc and Zambezi belt of southern and equatorial Africa and the Ribeira-Mantiqueira belt of Brazil show the applicability of the continental rifting model to all these belts.
Strict application of the rifting model describing the formation and further evolution of rift structures in the continental crust leads to the conclusion that the West Congolian belt, as traditionally described, is incomplete and has to be supplemented by the Mayumbian belt and a rift structure situated farther to the west. The Lufilian Arc is assumed to have evolved from two rift structures separated from each other by the later [{`]Domes} region'. The [{`]Golfe} du Katanga", which branches off northeastwards from the Lufilian Arc is interpreted as an aulacogen ([{`]Shaba} aulacogen').
The Pan-African-Brasiliano rift system is comparable to the Mesozoic Arctic-North Atlantic rift system with regard to size and distribution of rifts. Ocean floor spreading and opening of a proto-South Atlantic Ocean most probably occurred along a main line of rifting situated between the west coast of Africa and eastern Brazil. The wedge-like ocean may have terminated at the [{`]São} Francisco-Congo cratonic bridge' between northeastern Brazil and Gabon-Cameroon. There is no evidence of ocean-floor spreading in the Zambezi belt, the Lufilian Arc and the traditional West Congolian belt, which are arranged along another major line of rifting.
Closure of the Pan-African-Brasiliano rift system took place during two successive orogenic episodes. The Zambezi belt, Lufilian Arc and West Congolian belt underwent their main orogenic deformation with prevailing {ENE-} and {WSW-oriented} tectonic transportation directions during the Katangan episode, at {\textasciitilde}900-750 Ma. The transcontinental sinistral Mwembeshi Shear Zone adjusted opposite movement directions in the Zambezi belt and Lufilian Arc and, at its western prolongation, concurrently supported opening of the Khomas Trough in the southern Damara belt.
The proto-South Atlantic Ocean, still opening during the Katangan episode, was gradually closed during the Damaran episode, at {\textasciitilde}750-500 Ma. Closure proceeded from north to south and was accompanied by northwest-directed subduction underneath the Brazilian plate and southeast-directed tectonic transportation in the Kaoko, Damara and Gariep belts. In the previously formed West Congolian belt, Lufilian Arc and Zambezi belt a second deformation phase characterized by strike-slip faulting and local emplacement of nappes occurred during this episode.},

It was thus ideal for evaluating seismic azimuthal imaging versus acquisition geometries for both pressure waves and converted shear waves (Thompson et al, 2002). Through extensive practical experience with the Statfjord survey, Statoil soon verified the benefits and took advantage of the full azimuth acquisition solution offered by {3D} {OBS.} Since 1997, {OBS} surveys have been carried out over a large number of Statoil's geologically complex North Sea oil and gas fields, providing detailed, structural images of the disposition of fault-bounded compartments. Through a discussion of geometric observations and studies from the Norwegian continental shelf, some of the benefit of using ocean bottom seismic for P-wave imaging will be demonstrated.},

Borehole breakouts without tensile induced fractures were detected from {UBI} logs. By analyzing statistically of borehole breakout orientation in two wells, it was found that while a mean azimuth of maximum horizontal stress in {CK-8} is N-S (s.d = 0.4°); the azimuth of breakout in {CK-9} varies as a function of depth with a mean azimuth 345° + 26°; which since no {3D} seismic survey has been run upon the field, assumed to be caused by active tectonic state. By utilizing presence and absence of borehole breakout and tensile induced fracture, as well as density, rock strength, pore and mud pressure in deviated borehole, in situ stresses magnitude in {CK-8} were constrained. The experiment showed that the state of stress is normal faulting regime and maximum horizontal stress magnitude is closer to {SV} comparing with Shmin. Pore pressure was predicted by deploying Eaton's method on observed sonic data deviation from normal compaction trend. Considering the behavior of breakout and pore pressure in {CK-8} in accordance with rock strength changes, demonstrated that the borehole gets more stable as pore pressure increases.},

	abstract = {Production of hydrocarbons leads to changes in reservoir pore pressure, resulting in changes in the stress acting on the reservoir and surrounding rocks. A decrease in pore pressure due to depletion leads to an increase in stress carried by the load-bearing rock frame of the reservoir, and may be accompanied by microscale deformation mechanisms such as cement breakage at grain contacts, grain sliding and rotation, Hertzian cracking at point contacts, plastic deformation of clay and mica grains, and opening and closing of microcracks (Schutjens et al., 2004). The increasing stress acting on the rock framework may also lead to compaction of the reservoir, and may result in problems such as surface subsidence, casing deformation, reactivation of faults or bedding-parallel slip. Evidence for stress changes in and around reservoirs undergoing depletion is provided by seismic events resulting from production (Segall, 1989; Grasso, 1992), and by time shifts observed using time-lapse seismic (Hatchell et al., 2003). This paper provides a brief introduction to reservoir geomechanics and examines the implications for time-lapse seismic, which has the potential to become a useful tool for monitoring the stress changes that take place during hydrocarbon production.},

On the basis of geological, geomorphological, and geochronological evidence, the authors propose that the South American continent may have experienced a clockwise rotation during the Eocene, which resulted in the relative displacement of hot spot volcanic manifestations from Cabo Frio (Rio de Janeiro state) to the western border of the Vitória-Trindade chain. At this time, several tectonic, sedimentary, and magmatic events took place that were capable of causing the inferred Eocene displacement. It is worth noting the coincidence between the northeastern trend of the oil fields of the Campos basin and the suggested path of the basin as it moved over the hot spot.},

Although the {AVO} response of a media containing gas-filled fractures increases with offset when the recorded line was parallel to the fractures, we observed a decreasing {AVO} response when the offset orientation was perpendicular to the direction of the fractures. Media containing fractures filled with water present no such differences; the {AVO} response increases with offset, perpendicular and parallel to the fractures. The results were compared to a generalized Zoeppritz solution for reflections from a layer with vertical fractures. The case study suggests that {AVO} response for different source-receiver azimuths may contain information about the internal structure of the subsurface.},

Then the stress equations are obtained for use in the computation of the stress field in the lithosphere with the satellite gravitational harmonic coefficients. The 5 × 5° global stress field in the lithosphere is computed from harmonics of 2-30°. The directions of principal stresses of this stress field agree favourably with the directions of principal stresses indicated by mid-plate earthquake mechanisms, in situ stress measurements and sensitive geological features. This result indicates that the drag forces exerted on the base of the lithosphere, due to gravitational mantle convection, may be among the driving forces of plate motion and a major source for the stress field in the lithosphere.},

This paper concentrates on tensile fractures and shear fractures created in predominately compressive stress fields; such fractures prevail in many areas. Stress-based and fracture-mechanics-based concepts are introduced. They are used to show how tensile fractures are created, how shear fractures can be produced through coalescence of tensile fractures and how shear fractures and tensile fractures can be created simultaneously. Which of these mechanisms acts, depends on the particular combination of stress field and material properties. Laboratory experiments and observations in nature obtained from an extensive literature review strongly support the theoretical predictions. They also show that actual fracture patterns are often produced by a combination of mechanisms acting simultaneously or in sequence. The better understanding of fracture genesis which should result from this paper is not only interesting by itself but is useful when interpreting exploration results.},

The experiments were performed over a range of confining pressures (from 5 {MPa} up to 60 {MPa)}, at ultrasonic frequencies in a Triaxial Hoek cell, using the pulse-echo reflection technique. The results of this study confirm that the {Bn/Bt} ratio of a fracture is dependent on the fluid fill. A value of Bn/ Bt of less than 0.05 was obtained for our wet (honey saturated) sample which is consistent with the prediction that this ratio should be close to zero for fluid saturated fractures. Values of {Bn/Bt} for the dry sample are significantly higher and increase with confining pressure from 0.2 to 0.5. It is suggested that a {Bn/Bt} ratio of 0.5 is probably a more representative value to use in modelling studies of gas filled fractures than the common assumption that Bn ≈ Bt.},

	abstract = {We propose an approach for estimating the permeability tensor using seismic emission induced by borehole hydraulic tests or by a fluid injection of an arbitrary nature. This approach provides a single estimation of the permeability tensor for the complete heterogeneous rock volume where the seismic emission was recorded. The approach is an extension of the method proposed by Shapiro et al. (1997) for the isotropic case. It is based on the hypothesis that the triggering front of the hydraulic-induced microseismicity propagates like a low-frequency second-type compressional Biot wave (corresponding to the process of pore-pressure relaxation) in an effective homogeneous anisotropic poroelastic fluid-saturated medium. The permeability tensor of this effective medium is the permeability tensor of the heterogeneous rock volume upscaled to the characteristic size of the seismically active region. We demonstrate the method using the microseismic data collected during the Hot Dry Rock Soultz-sous-For�ts experiment (Dyer et al. 1994). These data show that the corresponding rock volume is characterized by a significant permeability anisotropy caused by oriented crack systems. The maximal principal component of the permeability tensor has a subvertical orientation. It is about seven times larger than the minimal subhorizontal principal component.},

In both testing setups the true triaxial compressive strength for a given least principal stress increases significantly as the intermediate principal stress rises. The unjacketed rhyolite strength is, however, only 60 to 85\% of the strength under dry conditions, depending on the magnitude of the intermediate principal stress. In dry rhyolite the failure process begins upon dilatancy onset, followed by microcrack localization, and ending in a steeply dipping shear fracture. On the other hand, brittle fracture in wet specimens occurs almost immediately after the onset of dilatancy by the development of one or more through-going extensile fractures subparallel and adjacent to one of the unjacketed faces, resembling the extensile cracks leading to borehole breakouts in crystalline rocks. We infer that upon dilatancy the confining fluid intrudes and quickly propagates newly opened stress-induced microcracks subparallel to the unjacketed faces, leading to [`]early' failure.},

Angular variation of velocity and attenuation due to parallel and nearly parallel cracks and cracks with normals at a fixed angle to a given axis are presented. Anisotropy gradually decreases as the distribution of orientations is widened from exactly parallel to random. Increasing the aspect ratio of thin saturated cracks generally causes the elastic properties to approach those due to dry (gas-filled) cracks. For fluid-filled cracks the line singularity where the birefringent shear waves have equal velocity moves closer to the symmetry axis as either the distribution of orientations is widened or the aspect ratio is increased. Calculated attenuations due to Rayleigh scattering and viscous dissipation in crack-filling fluids are many orders of magnitude less than reported attenuations in the Earth. Viscous dissipation varies linearly with frequency and aspect ratio of thin fluid-filled cracks. A power-law distribution of crack radii, intended to represent that found in the Earth's crust, has no effect on the angular variations of seismic velocities or viscous attenuation but scattering attenuation is sensitive to the power-law exponent. Lognormal distributions of aspect ratio, also corresponding to observations in real rock, affect velocity as well as attenuation. Velocities derived from the theory are compared with those measured in laboratory specimens with known geometries of cracks.},

	abstract = {One of the fields in the Norwegian Sea has been imaged several times over the past decades, both with conventional narrow azimuth seismic surveys as well as with ocean bottom seismic. The extensively faulted structure of the field and the possible presence of a salt diapir cause imaging problems in some areas. Therefore, a simulation study has been initiated to judge whether or not a marine full azimuth acquisition geometry improves the image of the subsurface. For this simulation study, simplified velocity and density models of the field were created, containing the main features characterizing it, as well as the problem areas. The simulation was done with {3D} finite difference ({FD)} modeling. Data sets with and without free surface multiples were generated, and imaging from a full azimuth acquisition geometry was compared with imaging from a conventional narrow azimuth geometry. {FD} modeling shows that the full azimuth design generally leads to a better suppression of noise in the data, mainly due to increased fold. Depth slices show that fault edges are imaged sharper in a full azimuth geometry. Also, the image of and below the salt/limestone structure is improved. However, attenuation of multiple energy due to increased cross line fold is less than expected, except for the first seabed multiple. The low maximum frequency used in {FD-modeling} may have limited the increase in image quality with the full azimuth modeling.},

In form they are identical to the 'fault2010slip' conditions of Murty, Schoenberg and {Pyrak2010Nolte}, Myer \& Cook, in which the traction is proportional to the displacement discontinuity across the fault. It is possible to envisage a fault consisting of obliquely aligned cracks whose centres lie in the median plane of the fault but whose normals are not necessarily perpendicular to the fault. We have found the interface conditions for this model to be more complex than those for the fault2010slip model and involve elements of the stress tensor other than the tractions on the plane of the fault.

	abstract = {Motion along the transpressional plate boundary between the North American and Caribbean plates has produced displacement along the Hispaniola Fault Zone ({HFZ)} from the Oligocene to at least the late Miocene. Field studies along the {HFZ} in northwestern Hispaniola reveal solid structural evidence of this fault zone's strike-slip nature, which was previously mainly conjecture. New structural evidence along the {HFZ} suggests that left-lateral strike-slip faulting occurred in the late Miocene and possibly into the early Pliocene, rather than up to the early Miocene, as previously documented. The discovery of such recent deformation will impact on geohazard assessments in the area north of the Cordillera Central between the towns of Moncion and San Jose de las Matas. The main displacement along the master faults of the {HFZ} produce structural features predicted by a Riedel model for left-slip movement. The presence of high strength Cretaceous age rocks to the north and south of the master faults act like buttresses and have caused the faults to develop around their edges. The master faults exploit these pre-existing zones of weakness to form a pull-apart basin. Movement along the master faults is responsible for both brittle and ductile deformation. The sedimentary rocks in the pull-apart are faulted, folded, brecciated, stretched, and sheared.},

	abstract = {A method is reported for the production of synthetic porous sandstones containing cracks of known dimensions and geometry with respect to the matrix. A synthetic sandstone was manufactured from Sand cemented with an epoxy glue. The cracks of known geometry were introduced into the material in the manufacturing stage, by emplacing thin metallic discs in the Sand-epoxy matrix. These discs were chemically leached out of the consolidated porous sandstone. Acoustic anisotropy. and shear-wave splitting were observed in the synthetic sandstones. For the dry sample the observed angular dependence of the P- and S- wave velocities (at 100 {kHz)} compares well, qualitatively, with the theoretical models of Hudson and of Thomsen. Quantitatively, however, the experimental data fits Hudson's model better. For the case of a saturated sample the experimental results are in excellent agreement with Thomsen's model. Hudson's model, on the other hand, predicts a different angular dependence for P-waves. This demonstrates that the concept of fluid transfer between cracks and the ambient porosity can be a significant process. The results reported here are from the first successful experiment in which the theoretical models were tested on a porous material containing a known crack geometry.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND} The optimal management of a torn anterior cruciate ligament ({ACL)} of the knee is unknown. {METHODS} We conducted a randomized, controlled trial involving 121 young, active adults with acute {ACL} injury in which we compared two strategies: structured rehabilitation plus early {ACL} reconstruction and structured rehabilitation with the option of later {ACL} reconstruction if needed. The primary outcome was the change from baseline to 2 years in the average score on four subscales of the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score ({KOOS)} - pain, symptoms, function in sports and recreation, and knee-related quality of life ({KOOS(4);} range of scores, 0 [worst] to 100 [best]). Secondary outcomes included results on all five {KOOS} subscales, the Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey, and the score on the Tegner Activity Scale. {RESULTS} Of 62 subjects assigned to rehabilitation plus early {ACL} reconstruction, 1 did not undergo surgery. Of 59 assigned to rehabilitation plus optional delayed {ACL} reconstruction, 23 underwent delayed {ACL} reconstruction; the other 36 underwent rehabilitation alone. The absolute change in the mean {KOOS4} score from baseline to 2 years was 39.2 points for those assigned to rehabilitation plus early {ACL} reconstruction and 39.4 for those assigned to rehabilitation plus optional delayed reconstruction (absolute between-group difference, 0.2 points; 95\% confidence interval, -6.5 to 6.8; P=0.96 after adjustment for the baseline score). There were no significant differences between the two treatment groups with respect to secondary outcomes. Adverse events were common in both groups. The results were similar when the data were analyzed according to the treatment actually received. {CONCLUSIONS} In young, active adults with acute {ACL} tears, a strategy of rehabilitation plus early {ACL} reconstruction was not superior to a strategy of rehabilitation plus optional delayed {ACL} reconstruction. The latter strategy substantially reduced the frequency of surgical reconstructions.

The magnitude of the vertical stress (Sv) was calculated based on density and velocity checkshot data in 24 wells. Upper and lower bound values of the vertical stress magnitude are approximated by Sv = (14.39 × Z)1.12 and Sv = (11.67 × Z)1.15 functions respectively (where Z is depth in km and Sv is in {MPa).} Leak-off test data from the two basins constrain the lower bound estimate for the minimum horizontal stress (Shmin) magnitude to 15.5 {MPa/km.} Closure pressures from a large number of minifrac tests indicate considerable scatter in the minimum horizontal stress magnitude, with values approaching the magnitude of the vertical stress in some areas. The magnitude of the maximum horizontal stress ({SHmax)} was constrained by the frictional limits to stress beyond which faulting occurs and by the presence of drilling-induced tensile fractures in some wells. The maximum horizontal stress magnitude can only be loosely constrained regionally using frictional limits, due to the variability of both the minimum horizontal stress and vertical stress estimates. However, the maximum horizontal stress and thus the full stress tensor can be better constrained at individual well locations, as demonstrated in Bulyeroo-1 and Dullingari North-8, where the necessary data (i.e. image logs, minifrac tests and density logs) are available. The stress magnitudes determined indicate a predominantly strike-slip fault stress regime ({SHmax} {\textgreater} Sv {\textgreater} Shmin) at a depth of between 1 and 3 km in the Cooper-Eromanga Basins. However, some areas of the basin are transitional between strike-slip and reverse fault stress regimes ({SHmax} {\textgreater} Sv [approximate] Shmin). Large differential stresses in the Cooper-Eromanga Basins indicate a high upper crustal strength for the region, consistent with other intraplate regions. We propose that the in situ stress field in the Cooper-Eromanga Basins is a direct result of the complex interaction of tectonic stresses from the convergent plate boundaries surrounding the Indo-Australian plate that are transmitted into the center of the plate through a high-strength upper crust.},

Wavespeeds are obtained for wavelengths long compared with crack dimensions by working to the lowest order in frequency. To find the attenuation due to scattering of energy out of the mean wave, calculations to higher order in frequency are necessary and, up to now, attenuation has been obtained by summing over the scattering cross-sections of the cracks, thus neglecting any crack-crack interactions. Here we evaluate scattering attenuation to higher order in the series obtained from the smoothing approximation in order to allow for multiple scattering. It turns out that, for crack radii and crack spacing small compared with a wavelength, the term of lowest order taken from the double scattering component exactly cancels out the sum over scattering cross-sections, leaving only higher order terms to account for attenuation due to scattering. In other words, the effective material parameters contain no attenuation component arising from scattering.},

	abstract = {Abstract  Typical pull-apart structures were created in scaled clay experiments with a pure strike-slip geometry (Riedel type experiments). A clay slab represents the sedimentary cover above a strike-slip fault in the rigid basement. At an early stage of the development of the deformation zone, synthetic shear fractures (Riedel shears) within the clay slab display dilatational behaviour. With increasing basal displacement the Riedel shears rotate and open further, developing into long, narrow and deep troughs. The shear displacement and the low angle with the prescribed principal basal fault set them apart from tension gashes. At a more evolved stage, synthetic segments (Y-shears) parallel to the basal principal fault develop and accommodate progressive strike-slip deformation. The Y-shears connect the tips of adjacent troughs developed from the earlier Riedel shears, resulting in the typical rhomb-shaped structures characteristic for pull-apart basins. The Strait of Sicily rift zone, with major strike-slip systems being active from the Miocene to the Present, comprises pull-apart basins at different length scales, for which the structural record suggests development by a mechanism similar to that observed in our experiments.},

	abstract = {Mapping seismic data from one acquisition geometry to another is an extremely useful technology. There are several reasonably well known proposed solutions to this problem. These include offerings from Canning and Gardner (Canning and {Gardner,1996),Bleistein} (Bleistein and Jaramillo, 2000), Stolt (Stolt, 2002), Biondi, Fomel, and Chemingue (Biondi et al.,2001; Fomel and {Biondi,1995;Chemingui} and Biondi,1995; Biondi and {Chemingui,1994;Fomel,2003).All} of these articles provide at least one method for mapping input data with arbitrary source-receiver azimuths to data with a fixed source-receiver azimuth. Because it is at least partially based on knowledge of a velocity model for imaging, Bleistein methodology requires the generation of traveltimes and consequently requires a reasonably accurate interval velocity model. Stolt's method circumvents this problem by avoiding the depth domain. The approach developed by Biondi, Fomel, and Chemingue, which I will call integral {AMO} and is based only on normal moveout velocities, offers the potential for an efficient easily parallelized space-time algorithm. In contrast, the method of Canning and Gardner, which I will call F-K {AMO}, is completely velocity {independent.A} primary reason for interest in data mapping exercises is the fact that many modern imaging and coherent noise (e.g. multiple) suppression algorithms demand a specific acquisition geometry. Such requirements range from common-azimuth to full azimuth and full offset geometries. Having a specific geometry allows one to formulate a specific algorithm whose efficiency is dramatically improved by the fact that the data has a specific order or style. Increased efficiency relates directly to increased speed and turnaround and is certainly desirable in a modern fast-paced exploration {setting.In} this article, I investigate the extent to which full azimuth data can be produced from relatively narrow-azimuth data. While I focus on integral and F-K {AMO} the fundamental idea is simple. Instead of trying to generate a full areal shot at each and every location, I generate multiple fixed offset and azimuth volumes. Extracting a fixed receiver ensemble from each of these volumes creates, by source-receiver reciprocity, a full azimuth areal shot. While the implementation of the formulas of integral {AMO} can be more difficult then the approach of Canning and Gardner, the somewhat better amplitude control of integral {AMO} tends to produce a better result. Amplitude control is a critical aspect of data mapping, so it also becomes a key part of the testing and evaluation process. Because of certain potential irregularities in the formulation of integral {AMO}, it is often not easy to achieve.},

	abstract = {The paper examines aspects of the sedimentology and stratigraphy of rift basins that evolved in deep marine settings near the ocean-continent transition. It focuses on the applicability of a low-angle extensional detachment model developed in the Alps to the West Iberian margin, and on difficulties of objectively identifying syn-rift stratigraphic intervals in both areas. The paper examines evidence obtained from Ocean Drilling Program holes drilled in the Iberia Abyssal Plain. Despite the fact that all the holes were sited above highs in the acoustic basement and so did not penetrate a complete sedimentary record of rifting, they do provide some constraints on the age and mechanism of rifting. We suggest that published identifications of syn-rift intervals in distal basins off West Iberia and in the Southern Alps have not demonstrated, using objective criteria, the occurrence of syn-rift stratigraphic intervals. They have, therefore, probably overestimated the duration of rifting by as much as 20 Ma. The absence of syn-rift related stratal divergence towards fault footwalls may be due to resedimentation of syn-rift sediments towards basin centres, lack of significant hanging-wall rotation along flat detachment faults, or the syn-rift interval being too thin to resolve on seismic data. The syn-rift episode beneath the deep Galicia margin postdates Tithonian-Berriasian shallow-water carbonates, and predates Late Valanginian turbiditic sediments. Drilling results from the Iberia Abyssal Plain suggest a similar age because Tithonian siliciclastic mudrocks are overlain by Berriasian pelagic chalks. It seems likely that in both regions rifting lasted for {\textless}5 Ma, probably from late Berriasian to early Valanginian. At Site 1068 in the Iberia Abyssal Plain, the interpretation from seismic reflection data, of a low-angle detachment dipping about 10\{degrees\} west, was confirmed by drilling, which revealed sedimentary and tectonic breccias containing clasts of lower-crustal rocks overlying a fault zone below which occurs serpentinized periodotite showing a downward decrease in deformation. At least 20.5 km of displacement is interpreted to have occurred along this fault, but it is not accompanied by large-amplitude, rift-related topography. This paradox is resolved if the detachment developed as a deepening-downwards, rolling-hinge fault.},

Interpreted axial (vertical) {DITFs} have previously been well described worldwide.

Elasticity theory predicts formation of both transverse and axial drilling-induced tensile fractures ({DITFs)} in vertical wells depending on the magnitude of the principal in situ stresses, pore-pressure and mudweight. Drilling-induced tensile fractures initiate in very specific stress environments. Axial {DITFs} can closely constrain a lower bound to the maximum horizontal stress ({SH} max) magnitude where the minimum horizontal (Sh min) stress is known. If transverse {DITFs} are observed, they can constrain a lower bound to maximum and minimum horizontal stress magnitudes. The observation of transverse {DITFs} on image logs can constrain the stress field to one on the border of strike-slip and reverse faulting () without requiring knowledge of the Sh min or {SH} max magnitude. The observation of transverse {DITFs} in the West Tuna area combined with wireline log data, leak-off tests and pore pressure data are used to constrain the in situ stress tensor. The interpreted in situ stress tensor lies on the border of a strike-slip and reverse faulting regime ({SH} max{\textasciitilde}40.5 {MPa/km{\textgreater}Sh} min[{approximate]Sv{\textasciitilde}21} {MPa/km).} Interpreted data from leak-off tests in the West Tuna area confirm that Sh min{\textasciitilde}Sv.},

Normally this requires positioning whole core within a total jacket which exerts triaxial pressure on it while ultrasonic transducers transmit both compressional and shear energy across the core uniaxially. The result is a better understanding of stress fracturing as a function of the application of the stress. Such a study requires a major test facility. We present an alternative approach to assist the understanding of the effects of stress, by forming synthetic whole core under pressure, and after relaxation, studying the effects of seismic wave propagation on the relaxationinduced fracture system. While this cost-effective method requires little more than a car jack and ultrasonic transducers, it can be extended to provide useful knowledge of the effects of other matrix parameters.},

	abstract = {A model of parallel slip interfaces simulates the behaviour of a fracture system composed of large, closely spaced, aligned joints. The model admits any fracture system anisotropy: triclinic (the most general), monoclinic, orthorhombic or transversely isotropic, and this is specified by the form of the 3 × 3 fracture system compliance matrix. The fracture system may be embedded in an anisotropic elastic background with no restrictions on the type of anisotropy. To compute the long wavelength equivalent moduli of the fractured medium requires at most the inversion of two 3 × 3 matrices. When the fractures are assumed on average to have rotational symmetry (transversely isotropic fracture system behaviour) and the background is assumed isotropic, the resulting equivalent medium is transversely isotropic and the effect of the additional compliance of the fracture system may be specified by two parameters (in addition to the two isotropic parameters of the isotropic background). Dilute systems of flat aligned microcracks in an isotropic background yield an equivalent medium of the same form as that of the isotropic medium with large joints, i.e. there are two additional parameters due to the presence of the microcracks which play roles in the stress-strain relations of the equivalent medium identical to those played by the parameters due to the presence of large joints. Thus, knowledge of the total of four parameters describing the anisotropy of such a fractured medium tells nothing of the size or concentration of the aligned fractures but does contain information as to the overall excess compliance due to the fracture system and its orientation. As the aligned microcracks, which were assumed to be ellipsoidal, with very small aspect ratio are allowed to become non-fiat, i.e. have a growing aspect ratio, the moduli of the equivalent medium begin to diverge from the standard form of the moduli for flat cracks. The divergence is faster for higher crack densities but only becomes significant for microcracks of aspect ratios approaching 0.3.},

	doi = {10.4085/1062-6050-48.3.13},
	abstract = {{Reference/Citation} :  Bleakley {CM}, Costello {JT}, Glasgow {PD.} Should athletes return to sport after applying ice? A systematic review of the effect of local cooling on functional performance. Sports Med. 2012; 42(1):69-87. Clinical Question :  Does local tissue cooling affect immediate functional performance outcomes in a sport situation? Data Sources :  Studies were identified by searching {MEDLINE}, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and {EMBASE}, each from the earliest available record through April 2011. Combinations of 18 medical subheadings or key words were used to complete the search. Study Selection :  This systematic review included only randomized controlled trials and crossover studies published in English that examined human participants who were treated with a local cooling intervention. At least 1 functional performance outcome that was measured before and after a cooling intervention had to be reported. Excluded were studies using whole-body cryotherapy or cold-water immersion above the waist and studies that measured strength or force production during evoked muscle contraction. Data Extraction :  Data were extracted by 2 authors using a customized form to evaluate relevant data on study design, eligibility criteria, detailed characteristics of cooling protocols, comparisons, and outcome measures. Disagreement was resolved by consensus or third-party adjudication. To perform an intent-to-treat analysis when possible, data were extracted according to the original allocation groups, and losses to follow-up were noted. The review authors were not blinded to the study author, institution, or journal. For each study, mean differences or standardized mean differences and 95\% confidence intervals were calculated for continuous outcomes using {RevMan} (version 5.1; The Nordic Cochrane Centre, Copenhagen, Denmark). Treatment effects were based on between-groups comparisons (cryotherapy versus control) using postintervention outcomes or within-group comparisons (precryotherapy versus postcryotherapy). If continuous data were missing standard deviations, other statistics including confidence intervals, standard error, t values, P values, or F values were used to calculate the standard deviation. The Cochrane risk-of-bias tool was used to assess the methodologic quality of included studies. Each study was evaluated for sequence generation, allocation concealment, assessor blinding, and incomplete outcome data. Studies were graded as low or high based on the criteria met, but the risk of bias across the studies was consistently high, so meaningful subgroup classifications were not possible. Differences in study quality and intervention details, including duration of cryotherapy interventions and time periods after intervention before follow-up, were potential sources of bias and considered for a subgroup analysis. Main Results :  Using the search criteria, the authors originally identified 1449 studies. Of these, after title and abstract review, 99 studies were deemed potentially relevant and kept for further analysis (1350 studies were excluded). Of the 99 potentially relevant studies, 35 were included in the final review (64 studies were excluded), with relevant outcomes of strength, power, vertical jump, endurance, agility, speed, performance accuracy, and dexterity reported. The 64 excluded studies were rejected due to intervention relevancy, outcome relevancy, and non-English language. In the 35 studies meeting the inclusion criteria, 665 healthy participants were assessed. Muscle strength (using an isokinetic dynamometer, cable tensiometer, strain-gauge device, or load cell) was assessed in 25 studies, whole-body exercise (vertical jump height, power, timed hop test, sprint time, and time taken to complete running-based agility tests, including carioca runs, shuttle sprints, T-shuttle, and cocontraction tests) was assessed in 6, performance accuracy (throwing or shooting) was assessed in 2, and hand dexterity was assessed in 2. Outcomes before and immediately after cryotherapy intervention were reported in all studies; additional outcome assessments at times ranging from 5 to 180 minutes postintervention were recorded in 11 studies. The review authors reported a high risk of bias: selection bias (poor randomization and concealment of group allocation), performance and detection bias (poor blinding of assessors), and attrition bias (incomplete data). Because of the diversity of studies, particularly with respect to cryotherapy protocols and the potential for rewarming before the posttest, the effects of cryotherapy on functional performance were mixed. From the included studies, the authors concluded that cryotherapy treatment reduced upper and lower extremity muscle strength immediately after cryotherapy. However, increases in force output after cryotherapy were reported in 5 studies. Regardless of the effect of cryotherapy on strength, the clinical meaningfulness of most of the data may not be important due to variability and small effects. Studies reporting outcomes of muscle endurance resulted in conflicting evidence: endurance increased immediately after cryotherapy in 6, whereas muscle endurance decreased in 3 . These conflicting results limit the ability to draw clinically relevant conclusions about the effect of cryotherapy on muscle endurance. The majority of studies evaluating whole-body exercise demonstrated decreases in performance after cryotherapy; these outcomes included vertical jump, sprint, and agility, even when cryotherapy was applied only to a body part. Additionally, cryotherapy appeared to decrease hand dexterity and throwing accuracy immediately after intervention, although an increase in shooting performance postintervention was reported in 1 study . Conclusions :  The authors suggested that the available evidence indicates that athletic performance may be adversely affected when athletes return to play immediately after cryotherapy treatments. Many of the included studies used variable cooling protocols, reflecting differences in time, temperature, and mode of cryotherapy. The majority of the included studies used cryotherapy for at least 20 minutes. However, when considering an immediate return to activity, this cooling duration may not be clinically relevant because cryotherapy applications during practice and competitions usually last less than 20 minutes. When immediate return to activity occurs after cryotherapy, short-duration cold applications or progressive warm-ups should be implemented to prevent a deleterious effect on functional performance.},

	abstract = {Objective:
To investigate whether the improvement in hyperglycemia by dietary control influences hyperglycemia-induced pathologies in tissues of juvenile obese (ob/ob) mice.

Design:
Five-week-old ob/ob mice were fed a very low carbohydrate ketogenic diet ({KD)} for 7 weeks. The blood glucose levels and body weight were monitored during this period. Biochemical parameters in the serum and tissue pathologies of the mice were analyzed at the end of the 7-week period.

Results:
The hyperglycemic phenotype of the ob/ob mice was improved by {KD} feeding for 7 weeks. Surprisingly, we found that {KD} feeding also drastically reduced the hepatic steatosis phenotype in ob/ob mice, while their obesity phenotype was unaltered. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis revealed that several proteins found in the liver of ob/ob mice fed a regular chow diet were undetectable after being fed {KD.} Liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry ({LC-MS/MS)} {MASCOT} search and western blot analysis revealed that the proteins absent from the mice fed {KD} included fatty acid synthase ({FAS)} and acetyl-{CoA} carboxylase 1 ({ACC1)}, which are key enzymes for lipogenesis in the liver. Fatty acid analysis supported the results because the ratio of C18:1, which is a major product of lipogenesis, was reduced by {KD} feeding. However, C18:2, which cannot be synthesized in mammalian cells but is present in the {KD}, was found to be a major component in the liver of {KD-fed} ob/ob mice.

Conclusion:
Hyperglycemia promotes hepatic steatosis via the lipogenic pathway in the liver of juvenile ob/ob mice. However, the development of steatosis is prevented by feeding {KD} owing to an improvement in hyperglycemia. We found that the progression of steatosis is reflected by the composition of fatty acids in the total lipids of the liver and serum.},

We present an appropriate approximation (not assuming weak {qSV-anisotropy)} that simplifies the conditions for the onset of off-axis triplication as anisotropy is increased, identifying the anisotropy parameter [sigma] as the controlling parameter. It follows that commonly reported surface-seismic P-wave move-out measurements imply that many formations in the earth's sedimentary crust support off-axis {qSV} triplications. For typical {Vp/Vs} velocity ratios and a horizontally stratified earth, however, off-axis {qSV} triplications appear to only occur for shear-wave incidence angles too far from the vertical to be sampled by surface-seismic converted-wave survey geometries.},

Am J Sport Med. 2004; 32:251-261. {CLINICAL} {QUESTION:} What is the clinical evidence base for cryotherapy use? {DATA} {SOURCES:} Studies were identified by using a computer-based literature search on a total of 8 databases: {MEDLINE}, Proquest, {ISI} Web of Science, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health ({CINAHL)} on Ovid, Allied and Complementary Medicine Database ({AMED)} on Ovid, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Cochrane Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effectiveness, and Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (Central). This was supplemented with citation tracking of relevant primary and review articles. Search terms included surgery,orthopaedics,sports injury,soft tissue injury,sprains and strains,contusions,athletic injury,acute,compression, {cryotherapy,ice,RICE}, andcold. {STUDY} {SELECTION:} To be included in the review, each study had to fulfill the following conditions: be a randomized, controlled trial of human subjects; be published in English as a full paper; include patients recovering from acute soft tissue or orthopaedic surgical interventions who received cryotherapy in inpatient, outpatient, or home-based treatment, in isolation or in combination with placebo or other therapies; provide comparisons with no treatment, placebo, a different mode or protocol of cryotherapy, or other physiotherapeutic interventions; and have outcome measures that included function (subjective or objective), pain, swelling, or range of motion. {DATA} {EXTRACTION:} The study population, interventions, outcomes, follow-up, and reported results of the assessed trials were extracted and tabulated. The primary outcome measures were pain, swelling, and range of motion. Only 2 groups reported adequate data for return to normal function. All eligible articles were rated for methodologic quality using the {PEDro} scale. The {PEDro} scale is a checklist that examines the believability (internal validity) and the interpretability of trial quality. The 11-item checklist yields a maximum score of 10 if all criteria are satisfied. The intraclass correlation coefficient and kappa values are similar to those reported for 3 other frequently used quality scales (Chalmers Scale, Jadad Scale, and Maastricht List). Two reviewers graded the articles, a method that has been reported to be more reliable than one evaluator. {MAIN} {RESULTS:} Specific search criteria identified 55 articles for review, of which 22 were eligible randomized, controlled clinical trials. The articles' scores on the {PEDro} scale were low, ranging from 1 to 5, with an average score of 3.4. Five studies provided adequate information on the subjects' baseline data, and only 3 studies concealed allocation during subject recruitment. No studies blinded their therapist's administration of therapy, and just 1 study blinded subjects. Only 1 study included an intention-to-treat analysis. The average number of subjects in the studies was 66.7; however, only 1 group undertook a power analysis. The types of injuries varied widely (eg, acute or surgical). No authors investigated subjects with muscle contusions or strains, and only 5 groups studied subjects with acute ligament sprains. The remaining 17 groups examined patients recovering from operative procedures (anterior cruciate ligament repair, knee arthroscopy, lateral retinacular release, total knee and hip arthroplasties, and carpal tunnel release). Additionally, the mode of cryotherapy varied widely, as did the duration and frequency of cryotherapy application. The time period when cryotherapy was applied after injury ranged from immediately after injury to 1 to 3 days postinjury. Adequate information on the actual surface temperature of the cooling device was not provided in the selected studies. Most authors recorded outcome variables over short periods (1 week), with the longest reporting follow-ups of pain, swelling, and range of motion recorded at 4 weeks postinjury. Data in that study were insufficient to calculate effect size. Nine studies did not provide data of the key outcome measures, so individual study effect estimates could not be calculated. A total of 12 treatment comparisons were made. Ice submersion with simultaneous exercises was significantly more effective than heat and contrast therapy plus simultaneous exercises at reducing swelling. Ice was reported to be no different from ice and low-frequency or high-frequency electric stimulation in effect on swelling, pain, and range of motion. Ice alone seemed to be more effective than applying no form of cryotherapy after minor knee surgery in terms of pain, but no differences were reported for range of motion and girth. Continuous cryotherapy was associated with a significantly greater decrease in pain and wrist circumference after surgery than intermittent cryotherapy. Evidence was marginal that a single simultaneous treatment with ice and compression is no more effective than no cryotherapy after an ankle sprain. The authors reported ice to be no more effective than rehabilitation only with regard to pain, swelling, and range of motion. Ice and compression seemed to be significantly more effective than ice alone in terms of decreasing pain. Additionally, ice, compression, and a placebo injection reduced pain more than a placebo injection alone. Lastly, in 8 studies, there seemed to be little difference in the effectiveness of ice and compression compared with compression alone. Only 2 of the 8 groups reported significant differences in favor of ice and compression. {CONCLUSIONS:} Based on the available evidence, cryotherapy seems to be effective in decreasing pain. In comparison with other rehabilitation techniques, the efficacy of cryotherapy has been questioned. The exact effect of cryotherapy on more frequently treated acute injuries (eg, muscle strains and contusions) has not been fully elucidated. Additionally, the low methodologic quality of the available evidence is of concern. Many more high-quality studies are required to create evidence-based guidelines on the use of cryotherapy. These must focus on developing modes, durations, and frequencies of ice application that will optimize outcomes after injury.},

	abstract = {Previously hypothesized fault weakening mechanisms include faults lined by low-friction clay gouges, elevated pore pressures within fault cores and/or the operation of dynamic weakening during seismic slip. Geological studies to support dynamic weakening are still in their infancy and there is little geological evidence for the widespread occurrence of low-friction gouges. The cores of some ancient faults exhumed from {\textless}5 km depth contain sheared syntectonic mineral veins. This observation is consistent with elevated pore pressures, but the implications for long-term fault weakening are unclear. Experimental data and microphysical modelling suggest that frictional-viscous flow within phyllosilicate-rich fault rocks (phyllonites, some foliated cataclasites) can cause sufficient weakening of crustal faults to satisfy published heat flow constraints. These predictions are consistent with the common occurrence of phyllonite in the cores of large-displacement faults exhumed from {\textgreater}5 km depth. Comparison with seismological data suggests that some faults with phyllonitic cores are likely to generate large earthquakes. Future studies should establish the geological evidence for seismic slip within phyllonitic fault cores and quantify the partitioning between seismic slip and frictional-viscous flow. Further geological observations are also required to test the hypothesized mechanisms by which earthquakes can nucleate and propagate along phyllosilicate-rich faults.},

Subjects Seventy-four subjects with {ACL} reconstruction participated in the study.
Methods The study was a randomized, single-blinded, controlled trial. The {NT} and {ST} groups were tested preoperatively and at 3 and 6 months. The main outcome measure was the Cincinnati Knee Score. Secondary outcome measures were visual analog scales ({VASs)} for pain and function, the 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey ({SF-36)}, hop tests, isokinetic muscle strength, proprioception, and static and dynamic balance tests.
Results The {NT} group demonstrated significantly improved Cincinnati Knee Scores and {VAS} scores for global knee function compared with the {ST} group at the 6-month follow-up. There were no significant differences between the groups for the other outcome measures (ie, hop, balance, proprioception, and muscle strength tests).
Discussion and Conclusion The results of this study suggest that exercises included in the {NT} program should be part of the rehabilitation program following {ACL} reconstruction.},

Bouvet hotspot, and probably Trinidade as well, also shows little or no Cenozoic relative motion. Contrary to previous models. Bouvet hotspot is unrelated to the Meteor Rise-Cape Rise seamount chain. Instead, the bathymetric data, when compared with the predicted hotspot tracks, indicate another hotspot exists near the southernmost South Atlantic spreading ridge segment. New geochemical evidence from the latter region supports this hypothesis in showing the effects of "plume enrichment" from a source that is compositionally distinct from Bouvet. The peculiar zig-zag shape of the Cape Rise-Meteor Rise lineament is the result of this hotspot crossing the active transform segment of the Falkland-Agulhas Fracture Zone in Late Mesozoic times, followed by an early Cenozoic ridge-jump to the pre-weakened trace on the then South American plate. From the averaged Cenozoic absolute motions of the African, Antarctic, and South American plates, it is evident that Antarctica has been most nearly stationary in an absolute motion sense.},

	abstract = {Because they grow perpendicular to a minimum principal stress ([sigma]3), joints are paleostress markers. Younger joints may show a systematic change in orientation as they approach older, throughgoing, joints. This change in orientation reflects a change in the stress field in which the younger joint set is growing. Analytical solutions for the stress field around a single joint subject to a combination of opening (Mode I) and anti-plane shear (Mode {III)} loadings are given. The sense of rotation and change in magnitude of principal stresses near an existing joint are functions of the orientation and ratio of magnitudes of the far-field stresses and the coefficient of friction across the joint.
Assuming that a later, non-parallel joint nucleates distant from, and grows toward, the throughgoing joint, the stress field in which it is growing will be systematically rotated and changed by the presence of the throughgoing joint. The effect of interaction between the older and younger joints is ignored in the analysis. The systematic change in orientation of the later joint reflects the change in principal stresses near the throughgoing joint, and can be used to place approximate limits on the ratio of the far-field horizontal stresses.
Zoned joints are individual, subparallel en échelon joints which are confined to a narrow zone, separated from adjacent zones by a characteristic distance, and confined to a single lithologic interval. A joint zone can be modeled as a single, infinitely long joint with a characteristic height.
Comparison of analytic stress field solutions with field examples of interacting zoned joints in Arches National Park, Utah, suggest that a curving-parallel geometry of younger joints is indicative of a stress field in which . A curving-perpendicular geometry of younger zones is compatible with principal stress ratios of .},

	abstract = {Conventional wisddom has always assumed that fluids prefer to flow along fractures that are orientated parallel to the maximum in-situ horizontal stress direction. These fractures have the lowest normal stresses across them and therefore provide the least resistance to flow movement. However more recent work (Barton et al. 1995) has suggested that those fractures that are orientated such that they experience a high ratio of shear to normal stress are most likely to flow. These critically stressed fractures are in a state of stress that is close to failure, allowing them to undergo a degree of shear. Even small shear displacements can cause significant dilation along a fracture surface as the two surfaces un-mate during sliding. This dilation results in a significant increase in fracture permeability, resulting in an increase in flow from these features. A review of past work reveals that this shear mechanism may be more important than previously thought. A case study from Sellafield in the {UK} is presented, where the critical stress technique has been successfully applied for predicting zones of enhanced permeability at the well scale. Difficulties for implementing the technique on a wider field wide scale are discussed.},

	abstract = {The experimental work described in this paper was carried out in order to discover more about the laws governing the effect of the stress system on brittle fracture, with particular reference to rocks. Consideration of the implications of Griffith's theory of brittle fracture when an arbitrary, uniform plane stress system is applied (Murrell 1964a, b) enabled a number of fracture criteria to be postulated for triaxial stress conditions which required experimental investigation. An apparatus has been built which enables cylindrical rock specimens to be subjected to various combinations of principal stress (tension with compression, triaxial compression with the intermediate principal stress equal either to the major or the minor principal stress) with or without a controlled pore pressure, and at the same time enables the axial and diametral strains to be measured. Confining pressures of up to 4kb can be applied, with pore pressures up to 2kb. A new method of measuring the tensile strength of very brittle materials is described. Experiments were carried out on an isotropic sandstone. It is shown that with one principal stress tensile fracture occurs at a critical value of the tensile stress ({=K')} within the range of hydrostatic stresses which were studied. When none of the principal stresses is tensile fracture occurs when the shear stress ({03C4)} on the fracture surface reaches a value which depends on the normal stress ({03C3)} according to the law  where {03BB} ({4K')½} and n 0.61. Where pore pressures are applied 'effective stresses' must be used in the equation (that is, \&sgrave; must be replaced by {03C3'=03C3+p}, where p is the pore pressure). The intermediate principal stress has a slight but measurable effect on the fracture criterion. After fracture the load supported by the rock falls to a value which can be supported by friction between the fracture surfaces. It is found that Amonton's law of friction is not obeyed, and instead the shear stress () due to friction and the normal stress () follow a law  where {03BCo} 2 and n 0.9. Again 'effective stresses' must be used in the equation when pore pressures are applied. Pore water lowers slightly the parameters {03BB} and {03BCo} by some form of chemical action. When the shear stress required to cause fracture becomes equal to or less than that required to overcome sliding friction, fracture is no longer possible and there is a transition to ductile behaviour. This occurs at a confining pressure of {223C} 17 000 Lb/in2 (1.17 kb) in the case of the sandstone used in the experiments. Interesting fractures occur sometimes, after the confining pressure is removed, in specimens which have been plastically deformed.},

As proposed by theoretical, experimental, and numerical studies in the literature, there are angular and scale relationships between these faults.

According to the results of my compilation from the literature and measurements of pull-apart examples from northern Turkey, the acute angles of this type of strike-slip basin are clustered at 30°–35°. In metric scale, the consistency in their two-dimensional (2-D) geometry is well known as an aspect ratio of 3:1 between length and width. Basin length is a function of stretching associated with strike-slip displacement, and increased displacement causes the width of the fault zone to increase, resulting in wider pull-apart basins. However, the depth of a pull-apart basin is a function of stretching associated with strike-slip displacement. In this study, comparison of data related to pull-apart basin scales from the literature suggests that the depth is related to the length and width.},

Let one have the transmission responses measured at surface points A and B of a {3D} inhomogeneous medium in the presence of white noise sources in the subsurface. When these transmission responses are cross-correlated, one obtains the reflection response of the same medium as if measured at point A in the presence of an impulsive source at point B. The quality of the simulated reflection response strongly depends on the whiteness and the distribution of the noise sources. Reflectors present below the sources cause the appearance of some ghost events. Random distribution of the noise sources will, however, weaken these ghost events.},

This high permeability, three or four orders of magnitude higher than that measured on core samples, appears to be maintained by critically stressed faults and greatly facilitates fluid movement through the brittle crust. We demonstrate that such high permeabilities can maintain approximately hydrostatic fluid pressures at depths comparable to the thickness of the seismogenic crust. This leads to the counterintuitive result that faulting keeps intraplate crust inherently strong by preventing pore pressures greater than hydrostatic from persisting at depth.},

	abstract = {The Belluno syncline is a structure located in the Venetian fold-and-thrust belt in the Italian Southern Alps. This {SSE-vergent} chain mainly developed during the Neogene as a back-thrust belt of the Alps deforming the northern margin of the Adria plate. The syncline is asymmetric in shape, with a steep backlimb, as the forelimb of the paired Monte Coppolo Anticline; it is the result of fault-propagation folding during the development of the underlying Belluno thrust. In plan view the Belluno thrust shows a prominent curvature interpreted as reactivation of inherited Mesozoic extensional structures. The hinge of the Belluno syncline presents a similar curvature. Rocks cropping out in the syncline core are Upper Chattian to Langhian fine-grained molassic sediments, mainly siltstones and marls. Most fractures on the Belluno syncline have formed at high angles to bedding. The dominant fracture trends are subparallel and orthogonal to the fold hinge. Sometimes these fractures show plumose structures revealing extension (Mode I) fracture mechanism and therefore they are referred to as longitudinal (bc) joints and cross (ac) joints respectively. Other fracture trends oblique to the hinge line are found in measurement stations located on limbs distant from the fold hinge. They are referred to as oblique (shear) fractures. Throughout the western part of the Belluno syncline the fracture network maintains a roughly symmetrical distribution with respect to the fold hinge, suggesting a development in association with folding.},

This technique uses the bonded particle model for rock to represent intact material and the smooth-joint contact model ({SJM)} to represent the in situ joint network. The macroscopic behavior of an {SRM} sample depends on both the creation of new fractures through intact material and slip/opening of pre-existing joints. {SRM} samples containing thousands of non-persistent joints can be submitted to standard laboratory tests ({UCS}, triaxial loading, and direct tension tests) or tested under a non-trivial stress path representative of the stresses induced during the engineering activity under study.

Output from the {SRM} methodology includes pre-peak properties (modulus, damage threshold, peak strength, etc.) and post-peak properties (brittleness, dilation angle, residual strength, fragmentation, etc.). Of particular interest is the ability to obtain predictions of rock mass scale effects, anisotropy, and brittleness, properties that cannot be obtained using empirical methods of property estimation. This paper presents the theoretical background of the {SRM} approach along with some example applications.},

	abstract = {Background: Diets with a high glycaemic response exacerbate the metabolic consequences of the insulin resistance syndrome. Their effects on the incidence of gall stone disease are not clear, particularly in men.
Methods: Dietary information was collected as part of the Health Professionals Follow up Study starting in 1986 using a semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire with follow up until 1998. On biennial questionnaires participants reported new symptomatic gall stone disease, diagnosed by radiology, and whether they had undergone cholecystectomy.
Results: During 12 years of follow up, we documented 1810 new cases of symptomatic gall stones. After adjusting for age and other known or suspected risk factors in multivariate models, the relative risk ({RR)} for the highest compared with the lowest quintile of carbohydrate intake was 1.59 (95\% confidence interval ({CI)} 1.25, 2.02; p for trend = 0.002). The {RR} for the highest compared with the lowest quintile of dietary glycaemic load was 1.50 (95\% {CI} 1.20, 1.88; p for trend = 0.0008), and 1.18 for dietary glycaemic index (95\% {CI} 1.01, 1.39; p for trend = 0.04). Independent positive associations were also seen for intakes of starch, sucrose, and fructose.
Conclusions: Our findings suggest that a high intake of carbohydrate, glycaemic load, and glycaemic index increases the risk of symptomatic gall stone disease in men. These results add to the concern that low fat high carbohydrate diets may not be an optimal dietary recommendation.},

	abstract = {One of the most important seismic areas in Brazil is the northeastern region with earthquake activity occurring mainly in the exposed Precambrian basement around the Potiguar Mesozoic marginal basin. Since 1986, temporary seismographic networks have been deployed at many sites near the border of the Potiguar basin and also further inland. This instrumental effort has allowed a better understanding of the seismicity patterns and crustal stresses in the region.   The seismicity in {NE} Brazil occurs mainly in swarms (lasting from months to many years) with shallow earthquakes (depths \&lt;12  km). These features and the large number of granitic/gneissic outcrops of the Precambrian basement allowed us to obtain good quality seismographic records, with clear P and S arrivals. Even with few stations and analogue recordings, reliable hypocentres and composite focal mechanisms have been determined with simple velocity models. The seismicity shows poor correlation with mapped faults. Several composite and single focal-mechanism solutions were determined: strike-slip faulting predominates in the area. Most nodal-plane solutions are in good agreement with the fault planes determined from the distribution of hypocentres.   The principal stress directions, obtained with inversion of focal mechanisms, show a strike-slip stress field in the upper crust with maximum stress orientation ranging from {SE2013NW} to {E2013W}, roughly parallel to the northern coastline. Well-bore breakouts in the Potiguar basin also show that the maximum horizontal compression is roughly parallel to the northern coast line. It is suggested that this pattern is the superposition of {E2013W} compressional regional stresses, generated mainly by ridge push and collisional boundary forces on the South American plate, with local extensional stresses perpendicular to the coast, generated both by the continent2014ocean structural transition and by flexural forces from sediment loading at the continental shelf.},

The sectional velocity and the sectional gradient are defined in terms of the motion of the curve of intersection of a front with a fixed surface. Section 2 (and 12) relates the coefficients of elasticity of the medium, the front types, and their respective rays. In section 12, the theory of fronts of arbitrary shape and of the corresponding rays for any anisotropic, homogeneous or inhomogeneous solid medium is summarized. In section 3 (and 13), the law of reflection and refraction of fronts on surfaces of discontinuity of arbitrary shape is presented. Sections 4 to 6 (and 14 to 16) treat some elementary applications of seismic travel time methods to homogeneous, uniaxially anisotropic media (=transverse isotropy) in greater detail. In section 4 (and 14), the travel time of a direct front generated by a point source is considered and it is shown how the coefficients of elasticity of the medium can be found based on travel time measurements. The seismic prospection of a plane reflector and of a reflecting boundary of arbitrary shape and position are discussed in section 5 (and 15). In section 6 (and 16), the seismic refraction method is used to locate a plane boundary between a homogeneous, uniaxially anisotropic and a homogeneous isotropic medium, where the boundary is perpendicular or at an arbitrary angle to the direction of anisotropy.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.tecto.2009.07.019},
	abstract = {The analysis of fault-slip data is a widely used tool in structural geology. This method consists of three major steps: (a) data acquisition by measurements in outcrops, (b) data separation into homogeneous subsets and calculation of the principal stress or strain axes with one of several available methods, and (c) data interpretation in a regional tectonic context, which includes the assignment of ages and the derivation of regional patterns. Each one of these three steps may introduce artefacts and misinterpretations. The major problem during step (a) is sampling bias due to unfavourable outcrop geometry or due to neglecting faults with subtle slip-sense indicators. Step (b) contains numerous possibilities to influence the calculation results, e.g. by arbitrary separation of data into subsets, choice of the analysis method, and uncritical use of software. Age assignment in step (c) can in most cases be made only indirectly, e.g. by the assumption that measured outcrop-scale faults have the same age as parallel map-scale faults or by the inference that subsets from different sites with parallel-oriented principal axes are syngenetic. Neither assumption is necessarily valid. With this paper we want to sharpen researchers' awareness of the problems related to fault-slip analysis.},
